## Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade qlik-sdk
```

## Getting started

A good place to start is our [examples](./examples/). Take a look and learn how to authorize and use our REST and RPC clients to access the APIs. If you're in a real hurry, the essence of our examples is shown below.

```python
from qlik_sdk import Auth, AuthType, Config

api_key = "<MY_API_KEY>"
base_url = "<URL_TO_MY_TENANT>" # E.g. https://foo.qlikcloud.eu.com

auth = Auth(Config(host=base_url, auth_type=AuthType.APIKey, api_key=api_key))

# For REST calls: auth.rest
# For RPC calls: auth.rpc
```

## Authenticiation options

### API keys

An API key is a token representing a user in your tenant. Anyone may interact with the platform programmatically using the API key. The token contains the user context, respecting the access control privileges the user has in your tenant. More info can be found on [Qlik Dev Portal](https://qlik.dev/basics/authentication-options#api-keys).

For a step-by-step guide on how to get an API key for your tenant, check this [tutorial](https://qlik.dev/tutorials/generate-your-first-api-key).
