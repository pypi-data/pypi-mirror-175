## Project Overview

- Traffic light classification plays an important role in Advanced Driver Assist as well as self-driving vehicle systems which ensures timely and appropriate reaction to traffic lights in cross sections.  
- In this project, a robust probabilistic approach based classifier has been implemented from scratch to classify traffic light signal's status using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
- Several data cleaning steps, features extraction and a probabilistic metric has been utilized.
- The classifier has been validated on a testing dataset with a **accuracy of 99.66 %**.
- All training stages and prediction stages has been throughly visualized & analyzed and thus improvised.
- The methodology utilized in this project can be generalized and applied to many other computer vision applications.
- The project presentation notebook is [Notebook Traffic_Light_Classifier](https://github.com/ShashankKumbhare/traffic-light-classifier/blob/main/Traffic_Light_Classifier.ipynb).
- The implemented Python package code is [traffic_light_classifier](https://github.com/ShashankKumbhare/traffic-light-classifier/tree/main/traffic_light_classifier).

## Data Description

This traffic light dataset consists of 1484 number of color images in 3 categories - red, yellow, and green. As with most human-sourced data, the data is not evenly distributed among the types. There are:

- 904 red traffic light images
- 536 green traffic light images
- 44 yellow traffic light images

Note: All images come from this [MIT self-driving car course](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) and are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

- Each image is a numpy array of shape (n_row, n_col, 3) i.e each image has a 3 channels (RGB - red, green, blue color space) where n_col and n_row is the height and the width of the image.
- Each image gives information about its colors of the pixels and their location.
- The RGB color space of the images can be converted to HSV color space channels (hue, saturation, value) i.e. the information about the hue, saturation and brightness of the pixels of the images.

---

## Methodology

### Feature extraction from the dataset
The features are in the form of either rgb values or hsv values of the pixels of the image and their locations.
- Some feature extracted:
  - Average hsv image for red images, yellow images & green images.
  - 1D range of high saturation along width and along height for each image.
  - 1D range of high brightness along width and along height for each image..
  - 2D Region of high saturation for each image.
  - 2D Region of high brightness for each image.
  - Location of light for each image.
  - Extraction of average red light hues, average yellow light hues, average green light hues from each image.
  - Average s (saturation) of light located.
  - Average v (bright) of light located.
  - etc.

### The classifier's training stages:
1. Get average image for red, yellow and green training images.
2. Get region of high saturation in average red, yellow & green images to narrow down the search window for individual images to look for the red, yellow, and green lights.
3. Crop all training images at their respective color's average image's high saturation region.
4. Locate lights in all images by using high saturation and high brightness regions.
5. Crop images at their respective light's position
6. Get average image of red light, yellow light & average green light to see the distribution of hue, saturation and brightness in red lights, yeellow light, and green lights.
7. Get distribtution of hues, saturations and brightnesses of red lights, average yellow lights & green lights.
8. Optimize classifier's metric's parameters for red, yellow and green lights.
9. Predict & get accuracy of training dataset for classifier's optimized parameters.

### Probabilities calculations and prediction.

#### <span style="color:skyblue"> Hues extraction </span>

For a single image, the classifier extracts the following hues from the 3 regions:
1. Model's red    hues from the light located in model's red    light region.
2. Model's yellow hues from the light located in model's yellow light region.
3. Model's green  hues from the light located in model's green  light region.

#### <span style="color:red"> Probabilistic model </span>

This classifier classifies an input image either red, yellow or green based on *probabilities*.

For a single input image, 3 lights will be located in the 3 regions (i.e. red, yellow and green light regions). Then the classifier calculates **3 probabilities**:
1. Probability of image being red
2. Probability of image being yellow
3. Probability of image being green

And propobilities are calculated by,
- $Probability\ of\ image\ being\ red    = \dfrac {strength_{red}}    {strength_{red} + strength_{yellow} + strength_{green}}$
- $Probability\ of\ image\ being\ yellow = \dfrac {strength_{yellow}} {strength_{red} + strength_{yellow} + strength_{green}}$
- $Probability\ of\ image\ being\ green  = \dfrac {strength_{green}}  {strength_{red} + strength_{yellow} + strength_{green}}$

  where,  
  - $strength_{red}    = \mu_{saturation_{red}}^a    \times \mu_{brightness_{red}}^b$
  - $strength_{yellow} = \mu_{saturation_{yellow}}^a \times \mu_{brightness_{yellow}}^b$
  - $strength_{green}  = \mu_{saturation_{green}}^a  \times \mu_{brightness_{green}}^b$
  
  and,  
    - $\mu_{saturation_{red}}$   : mean saturation of the light located in model's red    light region
    - $\mu_{brightness_{red}}$   : mean brightness of the light located in model's red    light region
    - $\mu_{saturation_{yellow}}$: mean saturation of the light located in model's yellow light region
    - $\mu_{brightness_{yellow}}$: mean brightness of the light located in model's yellow light region
    - $\mu_{saturation_{green}}$ : mean saturation of the light located in model's green  light region
    - $\mu_{brightness_{green}}$ : mean brightness of the light located in model's green  light region
    - $a$ & $b$     : model's parameters
