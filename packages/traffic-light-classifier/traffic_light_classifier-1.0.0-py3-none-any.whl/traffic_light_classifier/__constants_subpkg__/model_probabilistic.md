For a single image, the classifier extracts the following hues from the 3 regions:
1. Model's red    hues extracted from the light located in model's red    light region
2. Model's yellow hues extracted from the light located in model's yellow light region
3. Model's green  hues extracted from the light located in model's green  light region

The image with extracted hues above will be used in calculating the probabilities of image being red, yellow, and green. The probabilities depends not on the hues but on the corresponding average saturation and average brightness.

#### <span style="color:red"> Probabilistic model </span>

**This classifier classifies an input image either red, yellow or green based on *probabilities*.**

For a single input image, this classifier calculates **3 probabilities**:
1. Probability of image being red
2. Probability of image being yellow
3. Probability of image being green

And propobilities are calculated by,
- $Probability\ of\ image\ being\ red    = \dfrac {strength_{red}}    {strength_{red} + strength_{yellow} + strength_{green}}$
- $Probability\ of\ image\ being\ yellow = \dfrac {strength_{yellow}} {strength_{red} + strength_{yellow} + strength_{green}}$
- $Probability\ of\ image\ being\ green  = \dfrac {strength_{green}}  {strength_{red} + strength_{yellow} + strength_{green}}$

  where,  
  - $strength_{red}    = \mu_{saturation_{red}}^a    \times \mu_{brightness_{red}}^b$
  - $strength_{yellow} = \mu_{saturation_{yellow}}^a \times \mu_{brightness_{yellow}}^b$
  - $strength_{green}  = \mu_{saturation_{green}}^a  \times \mu_{brightness_{green}}^b$
  
  and,  
    - $\mu_{saturation_{red}}$   : mean saturation of the light located in model's red    light region
    - $\mu_{brightness_{red}}$   : mean brightness of the light located in model's red    light region
    - $\mu_{saturation_{yellow}}$: mean saturation of the light located in model's yellow light region
    - $\mu_{brightness_{yellow}}$: mean brightness of the light located in model's yellow light region
    - $\mu_{saturation_{green}}$ : mean saturation of the light located in model's green  light region
    - $\mu_{brightness_{green}}$ : mean brightness of the light located in model's green  light region
    - $a$ & $b$     : model's parameters
