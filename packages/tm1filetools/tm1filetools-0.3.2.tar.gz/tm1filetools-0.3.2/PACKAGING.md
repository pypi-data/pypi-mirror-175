# How to package

Pretty rough so far, can be improved/automated

## Bump Version

Bump version in `src/tm1filetools/__init__.py` e.g.:

```python
"""A package for working with files created by a TM1 database."""

from .tools import TM1FileTool  # noqa

__version__ = "0.3.2"  # noqa
```

## Publish to PyPI

```sh
flit build
```
