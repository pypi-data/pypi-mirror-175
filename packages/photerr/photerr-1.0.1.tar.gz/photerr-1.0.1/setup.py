Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), as well as the Euclid and Nancy Grace Roman space telescopes.\n\n# Getting started\n\nPhotErr is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:\n\n```bash\npip install photerr\n```\n\nNote that PhotErr requires Python >= 3.8.\n\nOnce installed, you can import the error models. For example, to use the default LSST error model,\n\n```python\nfrom photerr import LsstErrorModel\nerrModel = LsstErrorModel()\ncatalog_with_errors = errModel(catalog, random_state=42)\n```\n\nThe error model expects an input catalog in the form of a pandas DataFrame with true magnitudes, and it returns another DataFrame containing observed magnitudes and photometric errors.\nAny extraneous columns in the DataFrame (e.g. a redshift column), remain in the new DataFrame - their presence does not effect the error model.\n\n*If compatibility with Astropy Tables, Ordered Dictionaries, etc., would be useful to you, let me know!*\n\n# Tweaking the error model\n\nThere are many parameters you can tweak to fine tune the error model.\nTo see all available parameters, you can either call help on the error model\'s `params` object,\n\n```python\nhelp(errModel.params)\n```\n\nor look at the docstring of the corresponding parameters object,\n\n```python\nfrom photerr import LsstErrorParams\nhelp(LsstErrorParams)\n```\n\nAll model parameters can be overridden using keyword arguments to the error model constructor.\nBelow, we explain a few of the more commonly tweaked parameters.\n\n### *Changing the observing duration*\n\nThe example above uses the default settings for the LSST model, which includes 10 years of observing time.\nIf instead you want to calculate errors for LSST year 1, you can pass the `nYrObs` argument to the constructor:\n\n```python\nerrModel = LsstErrorModel(nYrObs=1)\n```\n\n### *Changing the band names*\n\nAnother parameter you might want to tweak is the name of the bands.\nBy default, the `LsstErrorModel` assumes that the LSST bands are named `u`, `g`, etc.\nIf instead, the bands in your catalog are named `lsst_u`, `lsst_g`, etc., then you can instantiate the error model with a rename dictionary:\n\n```python\nerrModel = LsstErrorModel(renameDict={"u": "lsst_u", "g": "lsst_g", ...})\n```\n\nThis tells `LsstErrorModel` to use all of the default parameters, but just change the names it gave to all of the bands.\nIf you are changing other dictionary-parameters at the same time (e.g. `nVisYr`, which sets the number of visits in each band per year), you can supply those parameters using *either* the new or old naming scheme!\n\n### *Directly setting limiting magnitudes*\n\nBy default, PhotErr tries to use the provided information to calculate limiting magnitudes for you.\nIf you would like to directly supply your own $5\\sigma$ limits, you can do so using the `m5` parameter.\nNote that PhotErr assumes these are single-visit limiting magnitudes.\nIf you want to supply coadded depths, you should also set `nYrObs=1` and `nVisYr={u: 1, g: 1, ...}`, so that the calculated coadded depths are equal to those you provided.\n\n### *Handling non-detections*\n\nThe other big thing you may want to change is how the error model identifies and handles non-detections.\n\nThe error model has a parameter named `sigLim`, which sets the limit for non-detections.\nBy default, `sigLim=0`, which means that only negative fluxes count as non-detections, however if you set `sigLim=1`, then any magnitudes beyond the 1-sigma limit in each band will count as a non-detection.\nYou can set `sigLim` to any non-negative float.\n\nThe `ndMode` parameter tells the error model how to handle the non-detections.\nBy default, `ndMode="flag"`, which means that the model will flag non-detections with the value set by `ndFlag`, which defaults to `np.inf`.\nHowever, you can also set `ndMode="sigLim"`, in which case the model will set all non-detections to the n-sigma limits set by the `sigLim` parameter described in the previous paragraph.\nRemember that `sigLim` also sets the detection threshold, so in effect, any galaxy magnitudes beyond the detection threshold will be set equal to the detection threshold.\n\nOne other option is provided by the `absFlux` parameter.\nIf `absFlux=True`, then the absolute value of all fluxes are taken before converting back to magnitudes.\nIf combined with `sigLim=0`, this means every galaxy will have an observed flux in every band.\nThis is useful if you do not want to worry about non-detections, but it results in a non-Gaussian error distribution for low-SNR sources.\n\n### *Other error models*\n\nIn addition to `LsstErrorModel`, which comes with the LSST defaults, PhotErr includes `EuclidErrorModel` and `RomanErrorModel`, which come with the Euclid and Roman defaults, respectively.\nEach of these models also have corresponding parameter objects: `EuclidErrorParams` and `RomanErrorParams`.\n\nYou can also start with the base error model, `ErrorModel`, which is not defaulted for any specific survey.\nTo instantiate `ErrorModel`, there are several required arguments that you must supply.\nTo see a list and explanation of these arguments, see the docstring for `ErrorParams`.\n\n# Explanation of the error model\n\n### *The point source model*\n\nTo derive the [Ivezic (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366) error model, we start with the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) for an object with photon count $C$ and background noise $N_0$ (which depends on seeing, read-out noise, etc.):\n\n$$\nNSR^2 = \\frac{N_0^2 + C}{C^2}.\n$$\n\nIf we define $C = C_5$ when $NSR = 1/5$, then we can solve for $N_0$ and write\n\n$$\nNSR^2 = \\frac{1}{C_5} \\left( \\frac{C_5}{C} \\right) + \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{C_5} \\right] \\left( \\frac{C_5}{C} \\right)^2.\n$$\n\nDefining $x = \\frac{C_5}{C} = 10 ^{(m - m_5) / 2.5}$ and $\\gamma = \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{C_5}$, we have\n\n$$\nNSR^2 = (0.04 - \\gamma) x + \\gamma x^2 ~~ (\\text{mag}^2).\n$$\n\nIn the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limit, $NSR \\ll 1$, and we can approximate\n\n$$\n\\sigma_\\text{rand} = 2.5 \\log_{10}\\left( 1 + NSR \\right) \\approx NSR.\n$$\n\nThis approximation yields Equation 5 from [Ivezic (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366).\nIn PhotErr, we do not make this approximation so that the error model generalizes to the low SNR regime.\nIn addition, while the high-SNR model assumes photometric errors are Gaussian in magnitude space, we model errors as Gaussian in flux space.\nHowever, both of these high-SNR approximations can be restored with the keyword `highSNR=True`.\n\nThe LSST error model uses the parameters from [Ivezic (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366).\nThe Euclid and Roman error models follow [Graham (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07885) in setting $\\gamma = 0.04$, which is nearly identical to the values for Rubin (which are all $\\sim 0.039$).\n\nIn addition to the random photometric error above, we include a system error of $\\sigma_\\text{sys} = 0.005$ which is added in quadrature to random error. Note that the system error can be changed using the keyword `sigmaSys`.\n\nAfter adding photometric errors to the catalog, PhotErr recalculates the photometric error from the "observed" magnitudes.\nThis is so that the reported photometric errors do not provide a deterministic link back to the true magnitudes.\nThis behavior can be disabled by setting `decorrelate=False`.\n\n### *The extended source model*\n\nThe [Ivezic (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366) model calculates errors for point sources.\nTo model errors for extended sources, we use Equation 5 from [van den Busch (2020)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846):\n\n$$\nNSR_\\text{ext} \\propto\nNSR_\\text{pt} \\sqrt{\\frac{A_\\text{ap}}{A_\\text{psf}}},\n$$\n\nwhere $A_\\text{ap}$ is the area of the source aperture, and $A_\\text{psf}$ is the area of the PSF.\nWe set the proportionality constant to unity, so that when $A_\\text{ap} \\to A_\\text{psf}$, we recover the error for a point source.\n\nWe include two different models for calculating the aperture area. The "auto" method from [van den Busch (2020)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846) calculates the semi-major and -minor axes of the aperture ( $a_\\text{ap}$ and $b_\\text{ap}$) from the semi-major and -minor axes of the galaxy ( $a_\\text{gal}$ and $b_\\text{gal}$, corresponding to half-light radii):\n\n$$\na_\\text{ap} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_\\text{psf}^2 + (2.5 a_\\text{gal})^2},\n\\quad\nb_\\text{ap} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_\\text{psf}^2 + (2.5 b_\\text{gal})^2},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma\\_\\text{psf} = \\text{FWHM}\\_\\text{psf} / 2.355$ is the PSF standard deviation.\nThe formula for the area of an ellipse is then used to calculate the aperture area: $A_\\text{ap} = \\pi a_\\text{ap} b_\\text{ap}$.\n\nThe "gaap" method for extended sources ([Kuijken 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11265)) is nearly identical, except that it adds a minimum aperture diameter in quadrature when calculating $a_\\text{ap}$ and $b_\\text{ap}$, and then clips aperture diameters above a certain maximum.\n\nCalculating errors for extended sources requires columns in the galaxy catalog corresponding to the semi-major and -minor axes of the galaxies (with the length scale corresponding to the half-light radius).\nYou can set the names of these columns using the keywords `majorCol` and `minorCol`.\n\n# Authors\n\n[John Franklin Crenshaw](https://jfcrenshaw.github.io) \\\n[Ziang Yan](https://yanzastro.github.io)\n\n[*Contributors guide*](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n',
