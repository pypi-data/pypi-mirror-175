# afam - ASC Files Analyzing Module

This package allows the user to analyze a ASC file, created by the EDF2ASC translator program of
SR Research. It converts selected events and samples from the EyeLink EDF file into
text, and sorts and formats the data into a form that is easier to work with.

It helps to perform the following operations:
 - Opening and closing the ASC file.
 - Matching words and messages to keywords (tokens).
 - Reading data items from the file, including recording start, button presses, eye events and
   messages and samples.

It contains the following event & sample classes:
 - **ASC_BUTTON** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "BUTTON" line
 - **ASC_EBLINK** - a dataclass used to store the data from an "EBLINK" line
 - **ASC_ESACC** - a dataclass used to store the data from an "ESACC" line
 - **ASC_EFIX** - a dataclass used to store the data from an "EFIX" line
 - **ASC_INPUT** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "INPUT" line
 - **ASC_MSG** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "MSG" line
 - **ASC_SBLINK** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "SBLINK" line
 - **ASC_SSACC** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "SSACC" line
 - **ASC_SFIX** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "SFIX" line
 - **ASC_MONO** - a dataclass used to store the data from a monocular "SAMPLE" line
 - **ASC_BINO** - a dataclass used to store the data from a binocular "SAMPLE" line

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install afam
```

## Usage
