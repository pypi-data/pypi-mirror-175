# QRL_graph
Reinforcement Learning for the quantum speedup in the graph

Given a graph, we try to compute the classical and quantum critical time. The definition of the criticial time is defined as the hitting time of the endpoints with the probility bigger than $p_0$. 

### Usage

```markdown
pip install qrl_graph
```
