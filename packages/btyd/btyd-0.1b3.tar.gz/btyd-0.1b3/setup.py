All existing Lifetimes functionality is supported, and Bayesian [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs) model implementations are now in Beta.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nBTYD can be used to analyze your users based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. Users interact with you when they are active, or "alive"\n2. Users under study may "die" or become inactive after some period of time\n\nIf this is too abstract, consider these applications:\n\n - Predicting how often a visitor will return to your website. (Alive = visiting. Die = decided the website wasn\'t for them)\n - Understanding how frequently a patient may return to a hospital. (Alive = visiting. Die = maybe the patient moved to a new city, or became deceased.)\n - Predicting individuals who have churned from an app using only their usage history. (Alive = logins. Die = removed the app)\n - Predicting repeat purchases from a customer. (Alive = actively purchasing. Die = became disinterested with your product)\n - Predicting the lifetime value of your customers\n\n\n## Installation\nBTYD installation requires Python 3.8 or 3.9:\n```bash\npip install btyd\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ColtAllen/btyd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating any *Pull Requests*.\n\n## Documentation and Tutorials\n[User Guide](https://btyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/User%20Guide.html)\n\n\n## Questions? Comments? Requests?\n\nPlease create an issue in the [BTYD repository](https://github.com/ColtAllen/btyd/issues).\n\n## Supported Models\n\n- **BG/NBD** Fader, Peter S., Bruce G.S.
