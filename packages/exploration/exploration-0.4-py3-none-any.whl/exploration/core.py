This file defines the main types used for processing and storing
exploration graphs. Key types are:

- `DecisionGraph`: Represents a graph of decisions, including observed
    connections to unknown destinations.
- `Exploration`: A list of `DecisionGraph`s with position and transition
    information representing exploration over time.

Decision: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: decision points are defined by their names.

A decision represents a location within a decision graph where a decision
can be made about where to go, or a dead-end reached by a previous
decision. Typically, one room can have multiple decision points in it,
even though many rooms have only one. Concepts like 'room' and 'area'
that group multiple decisions together (at various scales) are handled
by the idea of a `Zone`.
"""

Transition: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: transitions are defined by their names.

A transition represents a means of travel from one decision to another.
Outgoing transition names have to be unique at each decision, but not
globally.
"""


State: 'TypeAlias' = dict
"""
A type alias: states are just dictionaries.

They can contain whatever key/value pairs are necessary to represent
exploration-relevant game state. Typical entries might include:

- `'powers'`: A set of `Power`s the player has acquired.
- `'tokens'`: A dictionary mapping `Token`s to integers representing how
    many of that token type have been acquired.
"""


Power: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: powers are defined by their names.

A power represents a capability that can be used to traverse certain
transitions. These transitions should have a `Requirement` specified to
indicate which power(s) and/or token(s) can be used to traverse it.
Powers are usually permanent, but may in some cases be temporary or be
temporarily disabled. Powers might also combine (e.g., speed booster
can't be used underwater until gravity suit is acquired).
"""

Token: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: tokens are defined by their type names.

A token represents an expendable item that can be used to traverse certain
transitions a limited number of times (normally once after which the
token is used up), or to permanently open certain transitions.

When a key permanently opens only one specific door, or is re-usable to
open many doors, that should be represented as a Power, not a token. Only
when there is a choice of which door to unlock (and the key is then used
up) should keys be represented as tokens.
"""

Tag: 'TypeAlias' = str
"""
A type alias: tags are strings.

A tag is an arbitrary string attached to a decision or transition.
Meanings are left up to the map-maker, but some conventions include:

- `'random'` indicates that an edge (usually an action, i.e., a
    self-edge) is not always available, but instead has some random
    element to it (for example, a random item drop from an enemy).
    Normally, the specifics of the random mechanism are not represented
    in detail.
- `'hard'` indicates that an edge is non-trivial to navigate. An
    annotation starting with `'fail:'` can be used to name another edge
    which would be traversed instead if the player fails to navigate the
    edge (e.g., a difficult series of platforms with a pit below that
    takes you to another decision). This is of course entirely
    subjective.
- `'false'` indicates that an edge doesn't actually exist, although it
    appears to. This tag is added in the same exploration step that
    requirements are updated (normally to `ReqImpossible`) to indicate
    that although the edge appeared to be traversable, it wasn't. This
    distinguishes that case from a case where edge requirements actually
    change.
- `'error'` indicates that an edge does not actually exist, and it's
    different than `'false'` because it indicates an error on the
    player's part rather than intentional deception by the game (another
    subjective distinction). It can also be used with a colon and another
    tag to indicate that that tag was applied in error (e.g., a ledge
    thought to be too high was not actually too high). This should be
    used sparingly, because in most cases capturing the player's
    perception of the world is what's desired. This is normally applied
    in the step before an edge is removed from the graph.
- `'hidden'` indicates that an edge is non-trivial to perceive. Again
    this is subjective. `'hinted'` can be used as well to indicate that
    despite being obfuscated, there are hints that suggest the edge's
    existence.
- `'internal'` indicates that this transition joins two different parts
    of the same room, which are represented as separate decisions.
- `'created'` indicates that this transition is newly created and
    represents a change to the decision layout. Normally, when entering
    a decision point, all visible options will be listed. When
    revisiting a decision, several things can happen:
        1. You could notice a transition you hadn't noticed before.
        2. You could traverse part of the room that you couldn't before,
           observing new transitions that have always been there (this
           would be represented as an internal edge to another decision
           node).
        3. You could observe that the decision had changed due to some
           action or event, and discover a new transition that didn't
           exist previously.
    This tag distinguishes case 3 from case 1. The presence or absence
    of a `'hidden'` tag in case 1 represents whether the newly-observed
    (but not new) transition was overlooked because it was hidden or was
    just overlooked accidentally.

The norm is for zones at level 0 to contain decisions, while zones at
higher levels contain zones from the level directly below them.

# Commands #
#----------#

# Commands represent a simplified mini-programming-language for editing a
# graph and/or exploration. The language stores a single 'current value'
# which many effects set or operate on (and which can be referred to as
# '$_' where variable names are used) The previous 'current value' is
# also stored in '$__' for convenience. It also allows the definition of
# arbitrary variables, and calling graph/exploration methods works
# mainly via keyword arguments pulled automatically from the set of
# defined variables. This allows each command to have a fixed number of
# arguments. The following definitions specify the different types of
# command, each as a named tuple with a 'command' slot in the first
# position that names the command.

class TransitionEffect(TypedDict):
    """
    Represents one effect of a transition on the decision graph and/or
    game state. The `type` slot indicates what type of effect it is, and
    determines what the `value` slot will hold. The `charges` slot is
    normally `None`, but when set to an integer, the effect will only
    trigger that many times, subtracting one charge each time until it
    reaches 0, after which the effect will remain but be ignored. The
    `delay` slot is also normally `None`, but when set to an integer,
    the effect won't trigger but will instead subtract one from the
    delay until it reaches zero, at which point it will start to trigger
    (and use up charges if there are any). The `value` values for each
    `type` are:

    - `'gain'`: A `Power`s or (`Token`, amount) pair indicating a power
        gained or some tokens acquired.
    - `'lose'`: A `Power`s or (`Token`, amount) pair indicating a power
        lost or some tokens spent.
    - `'toggle'`: A list of `Power`s which will be toggled on one after
        the other, toggling the rest off. If the list only has one item,
        it will be toggled on or off depending on whether the player
        currently has that power or not, rather than based on the state
        of the toggle effect. Note that to track the toggle state, the
        order of elements in the list will be edited each time the
        effect triggers.
    - `'deactivate'`: `None`. When the effect is activated, the requirement
        for this transition will be set to `ReqImpossible`.
    - `'edit'`: A list of lists of `Command`s, with each list to be
        applied in succession on every subsequent activation of the
        transition (like toggle). These can use extra variables '$@' to
        refer to the source decision of the transition the edit effect is
        attached to, '$@d' to refer to the destination decision, '$@t' to
        refer to the transition, and '$@r' to refer to its reciprocal.

        This static method takes a string and returns a `Requirement`
        object using a mini-language for specifying requirements. The
        language uses '|' for 'or', '&' for 'and', '*' to indicate a
        token requirement (with an integer afterwards specifying the
        number of tokens) and either a valid Python identifier or a
        quoted string to name a power or token type required. You can
        also use 'X' (without quotes) for a never-satisfied requirement,
        and 'O' (without quotes) for an always-satisfied requirement. In
        particular, 'X' can be used for transitions which are only going
        to become accessible when some event takes place, like when a
        switch is flipped. Finally, you can use '-' for negation of a
        requirement; when applied to a token this flips the sense of the
        integer from 'must have at least this many' to 'must have
        strictly less than this many'.

class DecisionGraph(graphs.UniqueExitsGraph[Decision, Transition]):
    """
    Represents a view of the world as a topological graph at a moment in
    time. It derives from `networkx.MultiDiGraph`.

    Each node (a `Decision`) represents a place in the world where there
    are multiple opportunities for travel/action, or a dead end where
    you must turn around and go back; typically this is a single room in
    a game, but sometimes one room has multiple decision points. Edges
    (`Transition`s) represent choices that can be made to travel to
    other decision points (e.g., taking the left door), or when they are
    self-edges, they represent actions that can be taken within a
    location that affect the world or the game state.

    Each `Transition` includes a `TransitionEffects` dictionary
    indicating the effects that it has. Other effects of the transition
    that are not simple enough to be included in this format may be
    represented in an `Exploration` by changing the graph in the next step
    to reflect further effects of a transition.

    In addition to normal transitions between decisions, a
    `DecisionGraph` can represent potential transitions which lead to
    unknown destinations. These are represented by adding decisions with
    the `'unknown'` tag (whose names where not specified begin with
    `'_u.'`) with a separate unknown decision for each transition
    (although where it's known that two transitions lead to the same
    unknown region, this can be represented as well).

    Both nodes and edges can have `Annotation`s associated with them that
    include extra details about the explorer's perception of the
    situation. They can also have `Tag`s, which represent specific
    categories a transition or decision falls into.

    Nodes can also be part of one or more `Zones`, and zones can also be
    part of other zones, allowing for a hierarchical description of the
    underlying space.

    Equivalences can be specified to mark that some combination of powers

        """
        This method replaces one or more zones which contain the
        specified `target` decision with a specific zone, at a specific
        level in the zone hierarchy (see `zoneHierarchyLevel`). If the
        named zone doesn't yet exist, it will be created.

        To do this, it looks at all zones which contain the target
        decision directly or indirectly (see `zoneAncestors`) and which
        are at the specified level.

        - Any direct children of those zones which are ancestors of the
            target decision are removed from those zones and placed into
            the new zone instead, regardless of their levels. Indirect
            children are not affected (except perhaps indirectly via
            their parents' ancestors changing).
        - The new zone is placed into every direct parent of those
            zones, regardless of their levels (those parents are by
            definition all ancestors of the target decision).
        - If there were no zones at the target level, every zone at the
            next level down which is an ancestor of the target decision
            (or just that decision if the level is 0) is placed into the
            new zone as a direct child (and is removed from any previous
            parents it had). In this case, the new zone will also be
            added as a sub-zone to every ancestor of the target decision
            at the level above the specified level, if there are any.
            * In this case, if there are no zones at the level below the
                specified level, the highest level of zones smaller than
                that is treated as the level below, down to targeting
                the decision itself.
            * Similarly, if there are no zones at the level above the
                specified level but there are zones at a higher level,
                the new zone will be added to each of the zones in the
                lowest level above the target level that has zones in it.

        A `MissingDecisionError` will be raised if the specified
        decision is not valid, or if the decision is left as default but
        there is no current decision in the exploration.

        An `InvalidLevelError` will be raised if the level is less than
        zero.

        Raises an `InvalidDestinationError` if the reciprocal transition
        does not exist, or if it does exist but does not lead back to
        the decision the transition came from.

        If `setBoth` is True (the default) then the transition which is
        being identified as a reciprocal will also have its reciprocal
        property set, pointing back to the primary transition being
        modified, and any old reciprocal of that transition will have its
        reciprocal set to None. If you want to create a situation with
        non-exclusive reciprocals, use `setBoth=False`.

        If `cleanup` is True (the default) then abandoned reciprocal
        transitions (for both edges if `setBoth` was true) have their
        reciprocal properties removed. Set `cleanup` to false if you want
        to retain them, although this will result in non-exclusive
        reciprocal relationships.

        If the `reciprocal` value is None, this deletes the reciprocal
        value entirely, and if `setBoth` is true, it does this for the
        previous reciprocal edge as well. No error is raised in this case
        when there was not already a reciprocal to delete.

        Note that one should remove a reciprocal relationship before
        redirecting either edge of the pair in a way that gives it a new
        reciprocal, since otherwise, a later attempt to remove the
        reciprocal with `setBoth` set to True (the default) will end up
        deleting the reciprocal information from the other edge that was
        already modified. There is no way to reliably detect and avoid
        this, because two different decisions could (and often do in
        practice) have transitions with identical names, meaning that the
        reciprocal value will still be the same, but it will indicate a
        different edge in virtue of the destination of the edge changing.

        Given a particular decision and a transition at that decision,

        destination instead of wherever it was connected to before. If
        the new destination is the same as the old one, no changes are
        made.

        If `swapReciprocal` is set to True (the default) then any
        reciprocal edge at the old destination will be deleted, and a
        new reciprocal edge from the new destination with equivalent
        properties to the original reciprocal will be created, pointing
        to the origin of the specified transition. If `swapReciprocal`
        is set to False, then the reciprocal relationship with any old
        reciprocal edge will be removed, but the old reciprocal edge
        will not be changed.

        Note that if `errorOnNameColision` is True (the default), then
        if the reciprocal transition has the same name as a transition
        which already exists at the new destination node, a

        to avoid any possible name collisions. Either way, the name of
        the reciprocal transition (possibly just changed) will be
        returned, or None if there was no reciprocal transition.

        renamed.

        The tags and annotations of the merged decision are added to the

        connecting the nodes that were merged, these become self-edges
        of the merged node (and may be renamed if necessary).
        Note that all renamed transitions were originally based on the
        first (merged) node, since transitions of the second (merge
        target) node are not renamed.

        second, although you can set `mergeReciprocal` to `False` to
        disable this in which case the old reciprocal will lose its

        If the two transitions do not share the same destination, they

        Use `retargetTransition` beforehand to ensure that they do if you
        want to merge transitions with different destinations.

        A `MissingDecisionError` or `MissingTransitionError` will result
        if the decision or either transition does not exist.

        If merging reciprocal properties was requested and the first
        transition does not have a reciprocal, then no reciprocal
        properties change. However, if the second transition does not
        have a reciprocal and the first does, the first transition's
        reciprocal will be set to the reciprocal of the second
        transition, and that transition will not be deleted as usual.

        Given a decision and an edge name in that decision, where the
        named edge leads to an unexplored decision, replaces the
        unexplored decision on the other end of that edge with either a
        new decision using the given `connectTo` name, or if a decision
        using that name already exists, with that decision. If a
        `revName` is provided, a reciprocal edge will be added using
        that name connecting the `connectTo` decision back to the
        original decision. If this transition already exists, it must
        also point to an unexplored node, which will also be merged into
        the fromDecision node.

        If `connectTo` is not given (or is set to `None` explicitly)
        then the name of the unknown decision will not be changed,
        unless that name has the form `'_u.-n-'` where `-n-` is a
        positive integer (i.e., the form given to automatically-named
        unknown nodes). In that case, the name will be changed to
        `'_x.-n-'` using the same number, or a higher number if that
        name is already taken. In any case, the `'unknown'` tag will be
        removed from the decision.

        If a `placeInZone` is specified, the destination will be placed
        directly into that zone (even if it already existed and has zone
        information), and it will be removed from any other zones it had
        been a direct member of. If `placeInZone` is set to
        `DefaultZone`, then the destination will be placed into each zone
        which is a direct parent of the origin, but only if the
        destination is not an already-explored existing zone (in that
        case no zone changes are made). This will also remove it from
        any previous zones it had been a part of. If `placeInZone` is
        left as `None` (the default) no zone changes are made.

        If `placeInZone` is specified and that zone didn't already exist,
        it will be created as a new level-0 zone and will be added as a
        sub-zone of each zone that's a direct parent of any level-0 zone
        that the origin is a member of.

        Any additional edges pointing to or from the unknown node(s)
        being replaced will also be re-targeted at the now-discovered
        known destination(s). These edges will retain their reciprocal
        names, or if this would cause a name clash, they will be renamed
        with a suffix (see `retargetTransition`).

        The return value is a pair of dictionaries mapping old names to
        new ones that just includes the names which were changed. The
        first dictionary contains renamed transitions that are outgoing
        from the new destination node (which used to be outgoing from
        the unexplored node). The second dictionary contains renamed
        transitions that are outgoing from the source node (which used
        to be outgoing from the unexplored node attached to the
        reciprocal transition; if there was no reciprocal transition
        specified then this will always be an empty dictionary).

        An `UnknownDestinationError` will be raised if the destination
        of the specified transition is not an unknown decision (see
        `isUnknown`). An `UnknownDestinationError` will also be raised if
        the `connectTo`'s `revName` transition does not lead to an
        unknown decision (it's okay if this second transition doesn't
        exist). A `TransitionCollisionError` will be raised if the
        unknown destination decision already has an outgoing transition
        with the specified `revName` which does not lead back to the
        `fromDecision`.

        The transition properties (requirement and/or effects) of the
        replaced transition will be copied over to the new transition.
        Transition properties from the reciprocal transition will also
        be copied for the newly created reciprocal edge. Properties for
        any additional edges to/from the unknown node will also be
        copied.

        Also, any transition properties on existing forward or reciprocal
        edges from the destination node with the indicated reverse name
        will be merged with those from the target transition. Note that
        this merging process may introduce corruption of complex
        transition effects. TODO: Fix that!

        Any tags and annotations are added to copied tags/annotations,
        but specified requirements, and/or effects will replace previous
        requirements/effects, rather than being added to them.
