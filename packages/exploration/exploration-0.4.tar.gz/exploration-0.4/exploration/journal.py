- Authors: Peter Mawhorter

- Purpose: Parsing for journal-format exploration records.

A journal fundamentally consists of a number of lines detailing
decisions reached, options observed, and options chosen. Other
information like enemies fought, items acquired, or general comments may
also be present.

The start of each line is a single letter that determines the entry
type, and remaining parts of that line separated by whitespace determine
the specifics of that entry. Indentation is allowed and ignored; its
suggested use is to indicate which entries apply to previous entries
(e.g., tags, annotations, effects, and requirements).

The `convertJournal` function converts a journal string into a
`core.Exploration` object, or adds to an existing exploration object if
one is specified.

To support slightly different journal formats, a `Format` dictionary is
used to define the exact notation used for various things.

"""
One of the types of entries that can be present in a journal. These can
be written out long form, or abbreviated using a single letter (see
`DEFAULT_FORMAT`). Each journal line is either an entry or a continuation
of a previous entry. The available types are:

- 'zonePrefixes': Appearing followed by one of the words 'on' or 'off',
    this specifies whether or not the names of level-0 zones should be
    automatically prepended to all room names specified. This applies to
    anywhere a room name is specified which does not contain a
    `zoneSeparator` already, and happens as entries are being parsed.
    The zone used is the level-0 zone of the current target decision
    (the exploration's current decision in normal mode and the target
    decision in relative mode).
- 'alias': Followed by zero or more words and then a block of commands,
    this establishes an alias that can be used as a custom command.
    Within the command block, curly braces surrounding a word will be
    replaced by the argument in the same position that that word appears
    following the alias (for example, an alias defined using:

        = redDoor name [
          o {name}
            qb red
        ]

    could be referenced using:

        > redDoor door

    and that reference would be equivalent to:

        o door
          qb red

    To help aliases be more flexible, if '_' is referenced between curly
    braces (or '_' followed by an integer), it will be substituted with
    an underscore followed by a unique number (these numbers will count
    up with each such reference used by a specific `JournalObserver`
    object). References within each alias substitution which are
    suffixed with the same digit (or which are unsuffixed) will get the
    same value. So for example, an alias:

        = savePoint [
          o {_}
          x {_} {_1} {_2}
              g savePoint
          a save
          t {_2}
        ]

    when deployed twice like this:

        > savePoint
        > savePoint

    might translate to:

        o _17
        x _17 _18 _19
            g savePoint
        a save
        t _19
        o _20
        x _20 _21 _22
            g savePoint
        a save
        t _22

- 'custom': Re-uses the code from a previously-defined alias. This command
    type is followed by an alias name and then one argument for each
    parameter of the named alias (see above for examples).

- 'DEBUG': Prints out debugging information when executed. See
    `DebugAction` for the possible argument values and `doDebug` for
    more information on what they mean.

- 'START': Names the starting decision (and possibly a level-0 zone to
    place it in); must appear first except in journal fragments.
- 'explore': Names a transition taken and the decision reached as a
    result, possible with a name for the reciprocal transition which is
    created, and possibly with a zone name for the level-0 zone at the
    destination (if different from the zone of the origin). Use 'zone'
    afterwards to swap around zones above level 0.
- 'return': Names a transition taken and decision returned to,
    connecting a transition which previously connected to an unexplored
    area back to a known decision instead.
- 'action': Names an action taken at the current decision and may
    include effects and/or requirements.
- 'retrace': Names a transition taken, where the destination is already
    explored.
- 'wait': indicates a step of exploration where no transition is taken,
    optionally with effects that occur. Use 'action' instead for
    player-initiated effects.
- 'warp': Names a new decision to be at, but without adding a transition
    there from the previous decision. May also include a zone name to
    place the destination node into that level-0 zone (which will be
    created if necessary). If no zone name is provided but the
    destination is a novel decision, it will be placed into the same
    zones as the origin.
- 'observe': Names a transition observed from the current decision, or a
    transition plus destination if the destination is known, or a
    transition plus destination plus reciprocal if reciprocal
    information is also available. Observations don't create exploration
    steps.
- 'END': Names an ending which is reached from the current decision via
    a new automatically-named transition.

- 'requirement': Specifies a requirement to apply to the
    most-recently-defined transition or its reciprocal.
- 'effect': Specifies an effect to add to the most-recently-defined
    transition or its reciprocal. The remainder of the line should be
    parsable using `ParseFormat.parseEffect`.
- 'apply': Specifies an effect to be immediately applied to the current
    state, relative to the most-recently-taken or -defined transition. If
    a 'transition' target specifier is included, the effect will also be
    recorded as an effect of the most-recently-taken transition, but
    otherwise it will just be applied without being stored in the graph.
    Use this to capture surprising effects which only became apparent
    after a transition was taken, or without the transition target to
    specify changes that occurred without being associated with a
    transition (especially one-time changes).

- 'tag': Applies one or more tags to the current decision, or to either
    the most-recently-taken transition or its reciprocal if a target
    part is specified.
- 'annotate': Like 'tag' but applies an annotation.

- 'zone': Specifies a zone name and a level (via extra `zonePart`
    characters) that will replace the current zone at the given
    hierarchy level for the current decision. This is done using the
    `core.Exploration.reZone` method.

- 'unify': Specifies a decision with which the current decision will be
    unified (or two decisions that will be unified with each other),
    merging their transitions. The name of the merged decision is the
    name of the second decision specified (or the only decision specified
    when merging the current decision). Can instead target a transition
    or reciprocal to merge (which must be at the current decision),
    although the transition to merge with must either lead to the same
    destination or lead to an unknown destination (which will then be
    merged with the transition's destination).
- 'obviate': Specifies a transition at the current decision and a
    decision that it links to and updates that information, without
    actually crossing the transition. The reciprocal transition must also
    be specified, although one will be created if it didn't already
    exist. If the reciprocal does already exist, it must lead to an
    unknown decision.

- 'fulfills': Specifies a requirement and a power, and adds an
    equivalence to the current graph such that if that requirement is
    fulfilled, the specified power is considered to be active. This
    allows for later discovery of one or more powers which allow
    traversal of previously-marked transitions whose true requirements
    were unknown when they were discovered.

- 'relative': Specifies a decision to be treated as the 'current
    decision' without actually setting the position there. Until used to
    reverse this effect, all position-changing entries change this
    relative position value instead of the actual position in the graph,
    and updates are applied to the current graph without creating new
    exploration steps or applying any effects. Useful for doing things
    like noting information about far-away locations disclosed in a
    cutscene. Can target a transition at the current node, in which case
    that is counted as the 'most-recent-transition' for entry purposes
    and the same relative mode is entered.

"""
The different parts that an entry can target. The signifiers for these
target types will be concatenated with a journal entry signifier in some
cases. For example, by default 'g' as an entry type means 'tag', and 't'
as a target type means 'transition'. So 'gt' as an entry type means 'tag
transition' and applies the relevant tag to the most-recently-created
transition instead of the most-recently-created decision. The
`targetSeparator` character (default '@') is used to combine an entry
type with a target type when the entry type is written without
abbreviation. In that case, the target specifier may drop the suffix
'Part' (e.g., tag@transition in place of `gt`). The available target
parts are each valid only for specific entry types. The target parts are:

- 'decisionPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to a decision
    when it would normally apply to something else.
- 'transitionPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to a
    transition instead of a decision.
- 'reciprocalPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to a
    reciprocal transition instead of a decision or the normal
    transition.
- 'bothPart' - Use to specify that the entry applies to both of two
    possibilities, such as to a transition and its reciprocal.
- 'zonePart' - Use only for re-zoning to indicate the hierarchy level. May
    be repeated; each instance increases the hierarchy level by 1
    starting from 0.
- 'actionPart' - Use only for the `observe' entry to specify that the
    observed transition is an action (i.e., its destination is the same
    as its source) rather than a real transition (whose destination would
    be a new, unknown node).

The entry types where a target specifier can be applied are:

- 'requirement': By default these are applied to transitions, but the
    'reciprocalPart' target can be used to apply to a reciprocal
    instead. Use `bothPart` to apply the same requirement to both the
    transition and its reciprocal.
- 'effect': Same as 'requirement'.
- 'apply': Same as 'requirement'.
- 'tag': Applies the tag to the specified target instead of the
    most-recently-created decision, which is the default.
- 'annotation': Same as 'tag', but can also use a decision-part target
    to annotate the current decision (default is to annotate the
    exploration step).
- 'unify': By default applies to a decision, but can be applied to a
    transition or reciprocal instead.
- 'relative': Only 'transition' applies here and changes the
    most-recent-transition value when entering relative mode instead of
    just changing the current-decision value. Can be used within
    relative mode to pick out an existing transition as well.
- 'zone': This is the only place where the 'zonePart' target type
    applies, and it can actually be applied as many times as you want.
    Each application makes the zone specified apply to a higher level in
    the hierarchy of zones, so that instead of swapping the level-0 zone
    using 'z', the level-1 zone can be changed using 'zz' or the level 2
    zone using 'zzz', etc. In lieu of using 'z's, you can also just write
    as an integer the level you want to use (e.g., z0 for a level-0 zone,
    or z1 for a level-1 zone). When using a long-form entry type, the
    target may be given as the string 'zone' in which case the level-1
    zone is used. To use a different zone level with a long-form entry
    type, use multiple 'z's, or an integer.
- 'observe': The only place where the 'actionPart' target type applies,
    and that is the only applicable target type. Applying `actionPart`
    turns the observed transition into an action.

"""
Represents a part of the journal syntax which isn't an entry type but is
used to mark something else. For example, the character denoting an
unknown item. The available values are:

- 'on': The word or character used to indicate toggling something on.
- 'off': The word or character used to indicate toggling something off.
- 'unknownItem': Used in place of an item name to indicate that
    although an item is known to exist, it's not yet know what that item
    is. Note that when journaling, you should make up names for items
    you pick up, even if you don't know what they do yet. This notation
    should only be used for items that you haven't picked up because
    they're inaccessible, and despite being apparent, you don't know
    what they are because they come in a container (e.g., you see a
    sealed chest, but you don't know what's in it).
- 'tokenQuantity': This is used to separate a token name from a token
    quantity when defining items picked up. Note that the parsing for
    requirements is not as flexible, and always uses '*' for this, so to
    avoid confusion it's preferable to leave this at '*'.
- 'targetSeparator': Used in long-form entry types to separate the entry
    type from a target specifier when a target is specified. Default is
    '@'. For example, a 'gt' entry (tag transition) would be expressed
    as 'tag@transition' in the long form.
- 'reciprocalSeparator': Used to indicate, within a requirement or a
    tag set, a separation between requirements/tags to be applied to the
    forward direction and requirements/tags to be applied to the reverse
    direction. Not always applicable (e.g., actions have no reverse
    direction).
- 'zoneSeparator': Used to separate zone part(s) from a decision name part
    from a decision name which includes zone information.
- 'transitionAtDecision' Used to separate a decision name from a
    transition name when identifying a specific transition.
- 'blockDelimiters' Two characters used to delimit the start and end of
    a block of entries. Used for things like edit effects.
"""

JournalEffectType = Literal[
    'gain',
    'lose',
    'toggle',
    'deactivate',
    'edit'
]
"""
Represents a type of effect. The available types are:

- 'gain': The player gains powers and/or tokens. Multiple powers/tokens
    can be listed in a single effect line. Use the 'tokenQuantity' glyph
    to distinguish between powers and tokens (e.g., 'key' is a power,
    but 'key*1' is a single key token, if '*' is the 'tokenQuantity'
    marker).
- 'lose': The inverse of 'gain'.
- 'toggle': Lists multiple powers that will be toggled on/off in turn on
    successive transitions. If there's just one power, it is gained and
    then lost in succession, if there are multiple, the *n*th transition
    will cause the player to gain the *n*th power, and lose all of the
    other listed powers. TODO: Toggling for game states!
- 'deactivate': Deactivates the transition it is associated with, by
    setting the requirement to `ReqImpossible`.
- 'edit': This is the most complex effect: it is followed by one or more
    multi-line blocks (using `blockDelimiters`) which represent lists of
    commands to be run on subsequent activations of the effect. With only
    a single commands block, that block runs every time the effect
    triggers. With more than one, each subsequent triggering of the
    effect triggers the next block, until it wraps around to the first
    block again when it runs out. The commands are parsed using
    `core.parseCommandList` and saved as a list of commands (one such
    list per block) which is executed using
    `core.exploration.runCommandBlock`. The '@', '@t', '@r', and '@d'
    variables will be set when executing an edit command tied to a
    transition: '@' will be the source decision, '@t' will be the
    transition, and '@r' will be the reciprocal of the transition (if
    there is one) and '@d' will be the destination decision.

    The commands are executed in relative
    mode where the target starts as the decision + transition that the
    effect is being attached to. The commands in the block cannot exit
    relative mode (such a command would be an error) and so they only edit
    the graph without adding steps.

    The command blocks are interpreted like aliases, although they cannot
    use parameter substitution except for unique names.
"""

JournalEffectModifier = Literal[
    'charges',
    'delay',
]
"""
A modifier that can apply to an effect. One of:

- 'charges': Specifies that the effect can only be applied a certain
    number of times before being used up. An effect with charges
    subtracts one charge each time it is applied. If it has zero
    or negative charges, it will be skipped, and the number of charges
    will not be decremented.
- 'delay': Specifies that an effect doesn't apply until the nth time it
    would normally apply. Whenever an effect with a delay would normally
    be applied, instead the delay value is reduced by 1. Only if the
    delay value is zero or negative does the effect actually apply (and
    in that case, the delay value is unchanged).

class JournalObserver:
    """
    Keeps track of extra state needed when parsing a journal in order to
    produce a `core.Exploration` object. The methods of this class act
    as an API for constructing explorations that have several special
    properties. The API is designed to allow journal entries (which
    represent specific observations/events during an exploration) to be
    directly accumulated into an exploration object, including entries
    which apply to things like the most-recent-decision or -transition.

    You can use the `convertJournal` function to handle things instead,
    since that function creates and manages a `JournalObserver` object
    for you.

    The basic usage is as follows:

    1. Create a `JournalObserver`, optionally specifying a custom
        `ParseFormat`.
    2. Repeatedly either:
        * Call `record*` API methods corresponding to specific entries
            observed or...
        * Call `JournalObserver.observe` to parse one or more
            journal blocks from a string and call the appropriate
            methods automatically.
    3. Call `JournalObserver.getExploration` to retrieve the
        `core.Exploration` object that's been created.

    You can just call `convertJournal` to do all of these things at
    once.

    Notes:

    - `JournalObserver.getExploration` may be called at any time to get
        the exploration object constructed so far, and that that object
        (unless it's `None`) will always be the same object (which gets
        modified as entries are recorded). Modifying this object
        directly is possible for making changes not available via the
        API, but must be done carefully, as there are important
        conventions around things like decision names that must be
        respected if the API functions need to keep working.
    - To get the latest graph, simply use the
        `core.Exploration.currentGraph` method of the
        `JournalObserver.getExploration` result.

        Sets up the observer. If a parse format is supplied, that will
        be used instead of the default parse format, which is just the
        result of creating a `ParseFormat` with default arguments.

        If `zonePrefixes` is set to `True` (the default is `False`) then
        decision names will be automatically prefixed with the current
        level-0 zone name (separated by the format's `zoneSeparator`)
        unless they always contain a `zoneSeparator`. If there is not
        current level-0 zone, '_' will be used. This applies to decision
        names specified via the `record*` methods, which thereby
        includes decision names specified in journals input using
        `observe`. Use the `zonePrefixes` entry type to toggle this
        behavior on or off.

        Note that if a level-0 zone is applied or changed after a
        decision is created, the decision will be renamed.
