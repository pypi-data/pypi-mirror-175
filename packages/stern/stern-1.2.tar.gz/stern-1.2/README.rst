Help
------------
If you are just getting started with stern, you should be able to get started fairly quickly. 

The online documentation stays up to date with the development version of stern on github. This may be a bit newer than the version of stern you are using. To upgrade to the latest full release, run pip install stern --upgrade in your terminal.

Building From Source
--------------------
If you want to use features that are currently in development, or you want to contribute to stern, you will need to build stern locally from its source code, rather than pip installing it.

Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will involve compiling and installing all the stern dependencies. Once that is done, run the setup.py script which will attempt to auto-configure, build, and install stern.

This is how you help the stern module learn and achieve new technologies and features of the Python programming language.
