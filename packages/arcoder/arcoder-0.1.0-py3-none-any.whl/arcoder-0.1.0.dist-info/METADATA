# ARCoder

arcoder.py implements an abstract base class called `Encoder` along with two concrete
implementations: `ARCoder` and `Holmes`. Each has an `encode` method that takes a
string and encodes it into a series of symbols designed to be used for similarity
measurements.

```python
    >>> from arcoder import ARCoder, Holmes
    >>> a = ARCoder()
    >>> a.encode("Sohaib")
    ['suhaeb', 'suhib']
    >>> h = Holmes()
    >>> h.encode("Sohaib")
    ['sohayb']
```

The ARCoder algorithm is described more fully in
Moore, J., Hamid, S., and Bromberger, S.: "An Evaluation of Transliterated
Arabic Name Matching Methods".

The Holmes implementation is derived from
Holmes, D., Kashfi, S., Aqeel, S. U.: "Transliterated arabic name search",
_Communications, Internet, and Information Technology_, pp. 267-273. (2004).
