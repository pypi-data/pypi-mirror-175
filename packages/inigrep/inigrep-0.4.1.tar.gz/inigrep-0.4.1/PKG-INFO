Description: 
        inigrep is designed to read a particular simplistic dialect of
        INI configuration files.  In a sense, it can be considered as
        a "grep for INIs", in that rather than parsing the file into
        a typed memory structure for later access, it passes file each
        time a query is done, and spits out relevant parts; treating
        everything as text.  Hence, it's not intended as replacement
        for a full-blown configuration system but rather a quick & dirty
        "swiss axe" for quick & dirty scripts.
