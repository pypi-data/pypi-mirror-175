    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For installing this code we assume you have a Python environment set up, into which you can install packages via `pip`. If this isn't the case, we recommend installing the Anaconda `python` distribution, and using `conda` to manage the version(s) of `python` you have installed on your computer. One tutorial (of many) about how to get started with Python and creating `conda` environments is available [here](https://github.com/ers-transit/hackathon-2021-day0).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to install this code, run\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install chromatic-lightcurves\n",
    "```\n",
    "and it should install everything, along with all the dependencies needed to run the code. If you previously installed this package and need to grab a newer version, run\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --upgrade chromatic-lightcurves\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to install this code while being able to edit and develop it, you can clone its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic.git) onto your own computer. This allows you to edit it for your own sake and/or to draft changes that can be contributed to the public package (see [Contributing ðŸŒˆ Code with GitHub](../github)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install directly as an editable package on your local computer, run\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic.git\n",
    "cd chromatic\n",
    "pip install -e '.[develop]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `-e .` will point your environment's `chromatic` package to your local folder, meaning that any changes you make in the repository will be reflected in what Python sees when it tries to `import chromatic`. Including the `[develop]` after the `.` will install both the dependencies for the package itself and the extra dependencies required for development (= testing and documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can quickly test whether your installation worked, and what version you have, by running the Python code"
