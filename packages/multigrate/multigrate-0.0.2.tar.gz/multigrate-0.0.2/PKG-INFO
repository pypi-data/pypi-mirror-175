[![Tests][badge-tests]][link-tests]
[![Documentation][badge-docs]][link-docs]

ICML 2021 CompBio Workshop paper is on [bioarxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484643v1).

Also see the reproducibility [repo](https://github.com/theislab/multigrate_reproducibility).

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

-   [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

conda create -n multigrate python=3.10
conda activate multigrate
```

There are several alternative options to install multigrate:

1. Install the latest release from [PyPI][pip-link]:

```bash
pip install multigrate
```

1. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/theislab/multigrate.git@main
```
