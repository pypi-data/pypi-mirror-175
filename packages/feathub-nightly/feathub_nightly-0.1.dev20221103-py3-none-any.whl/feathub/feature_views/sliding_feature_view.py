    Derives features by applying sliding window transformations on an existing table.

    Supports per-row expression transformation and sliding window transformation. Does
    not support table join or over window transformation. Those features defined with
    expression transformation must be part of the groups keys of sliding window
    transformations used in this feature view. And sliding window transformations used
    in this feature view must have the same step size, window size and group-by keys.

    Unlike DerivedFeatureView, the number of rows emitted by SlidingFeatureView might
    not equal the number of rows in its source table. This is because the features
    defined by a sliding window transformation can change over time even if there is no
    change in the source table.

    The output fields of this feature view consist of the features explicitly listed in
    the `features` parameter, their group-by keys, and the timestamp field (if exists)
    in the source table. Other fields in the source table will not be included.
