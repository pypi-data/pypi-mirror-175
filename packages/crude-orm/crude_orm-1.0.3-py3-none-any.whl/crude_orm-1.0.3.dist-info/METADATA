Crude is a simple, lightweight ORM for Python which owes its ease-of-use to the
fact that it is a _descriptive_ ORM rather than a _prescriptive_ one. What does
that mean? It means you can access your entire database programmatically with 
just a few lines, without having to define any schemas or write any SQL 
commands.
