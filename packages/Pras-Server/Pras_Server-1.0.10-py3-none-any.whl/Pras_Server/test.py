# Note that some of the PDB files have up to 24 chains and each chain will       #
# be analyzed (SS assignment and ramachandran plots).PRAS overwrites each        #
# ouput file, except plots with numbers that the subsequent ones do not get      #
# up to (plot with number ending 7 or 8 cannot be overwritten except another     #
# structure has up to such number of chains, then it overwrites the previous).   #
# The output .pdb or .cif is always overwritten b/c each file is saved with the  #
# same name.                                                                     #
#                                                                                #
#                                                                                #
# ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT PRAS WRITTES IN APPEND MODE, YOU SHOULD ONLY KEEP         #
# PREVIOUS OUTPUT PDB OR mmCIF FILE IF THE NAME IS NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER!      #
#                                                                                #
# Depending on your computer's memory, processing the entire 494 PDB IDs may     #
# cause your computer to fail to allocate bitmap. So you can either comment      #
# assignStructure() and ramachandranTypes() or continue each time from where     #
# bitmap allocation failed. During our test we processed the whole 494 PDB IDs,  #
# assigned the SS elements and plotted the ramachandran types                    #
#                                                                                #
# Perhaps you should start the test with _82_pdbs which are distinct from        #
# _494_pdbs. When combined together, there are 576 PDB IDs!                      #
#                                                                                #
# Acess to internet is required for this test and the processing speed is subject#
# to your internet download speed.                                               #
