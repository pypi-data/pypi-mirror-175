# Quantuloop PBW simulator for the Ket Quantum Programming Language

This package provides the GPU accelerated quantum simulator PBW as a quantum execution target for the quantum programming language Ket. For more information on Ket, access <https://quantumket.org>.

The use of this simulator is exclusively for Quantuloop's customers and partners. Contact your institution to get your access token or visit <https://quantuloop.com.br>.

## Compatibility

* CUDA 11.2 or newer with compatible NVIDIA driver
* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA architecture >= 3.5 and <= 8.6
* Linux X86_64 with glibc >= 2.17 (compatible with most Linux distributions released after 2014)
  * Ubuntu 18.04 or newer.
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or newer.
* Python 3.7 or newer
* Ket 0.5.x

## Usage

Importing the `quantuloop.pbw` module sets PBW as the quantum target execution. Although, you can use the `quantuloop.quest.use_pbw` function for this proposal. Before the quantum execution, you must set your access token with `quantuloop.pbw.set_token`. See the example below.

```py
from ket import *
from quantuloop import pbw
pbw.use_pbw()
pbw.set_token('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN')
```
