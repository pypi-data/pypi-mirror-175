    Parameters
    ----------
    circuits : List[str]
        A list of quantum circuit in the form of a QASM string. You can use Qiskit to
        generate these strings.
    shot_count : int
        Number of bitstrings that are sampled from the final quantum state.
    credentials : Credentials, optional
        The credentials for running circuits on an IBM backend. This dictionary should
        contain key-value entries with keys `token`, `project`, `hub`, and `group`.
    backend : str, optional
        The backend device that should be used to run circuits.
