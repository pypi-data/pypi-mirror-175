# Path should define a keyword defined in paths.
# This will be used as the default path
path: local
paths:
    local: /path/to/local_data/
    remote: /path/to/remote_data/

# Here path is a keyword which has to be in paths,
# this allows easy use of multiple paths by using
# the -P flag:
#
# airway stages -P remote
#
# when you want to work on the remote data path
# without having to write out the entire path.
# Remove 'remote' if you only have a single data location.
# You may also define as many as you need.
# 
# The reason for this is to have a small file sample on
# local machine on an SSD for easy debugging, and then
# the full data on a remote NAS. Allowing easy switching
# between paths.


# Number of threads to be used, note that each patient
# only ever gets 1 thread, so all parallelization is per
# patient. Increase this if you have more threads.
workers: 8

# Whether data should be overwritten by rerunning stages
# generally useful to set it to True, but for safety 
# False is preferred
force: True

# Whether only a single patient should be computed all
# the time. Generally no reason to change this.
single: False

# May be specified to use a different executable for 
# Blender (such as /usr/bin/blender or /snap/bin/blender)
# Both Blender <=2.79 and >=2.80 should work, although if it
# doesn't you may specify a different executable here.
# Will not be needed if you never use blender in this project.
blender: /usr/bin/blender

# Whether STDOUT and STDERR should always be printed when running airway
verbose: False

# Whether stages should be removed before running them,
# WARNING: setting this to True can delete important data!
clean: False

# Whether a profiler should be run when running airway to find out
# where the most time is spent. (Currently WIP)
profile: False

# How many log files should be saved at most in ./logs/
max_log_files: 10
