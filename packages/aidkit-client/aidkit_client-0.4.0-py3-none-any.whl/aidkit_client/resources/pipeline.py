"""
A pipeline on aidkit consists of analyses and evaluations. Pipelines must be
configured using the web GUI. After a pipeline has been configured, it can be
run on a data subset and a machine learning model version of choice using the
python client.

Running a pipeline on a machine learning model and a data subset creates
a pipeline run. Finishing a pipeline run creates a report, which
contains information about the evaluations and can be used to download
adversarial examples.
