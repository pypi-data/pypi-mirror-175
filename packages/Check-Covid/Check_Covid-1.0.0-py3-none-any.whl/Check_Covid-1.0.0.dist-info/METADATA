\# Check Covid

# Data Formatting

First, data formatting. It is troublesome to read Excel files, so copy the lines of name and passport ID.

Do **NOT** include the header.

Then, go to your desktop, right click, new file, new text file, and paste the data into the text file.

Save and quit.

---

# Script Running

Install Python from python.org. If prompted, check `add Python to PATH`.

Next, open terminal by press **Windows + R**, type `cmd`.

Type `pip install check_covid` to install the package. 

Type `python` to open python. If `python` opens Microsoft Store, close Microsoft Store and type `py` instead.

Before you run the script, ensure that you have openned the corresponding WeChat miniprogram.

Move the miniprogram window to the top left corner. (It does not need to be very precise.)

Move the terminal window such that the windows do not overlap. Do **NOT** minimize the terminal window.

Enter `import check_covid` to start the program.

The program will ask you for how many days to search and whether to search for today.

For instance, to search for yesterday, that would be `1 day` and `no` today. Enter `1` and `n`.

Then, drag the text file you have created into the terminal window. Some text will appear.

This is called the `path` of your data file. Then, press Enter.

Finally, wait for the process to finish!!!

# Trouble Shooting

If the program outputs more than `10` consecutive `BRUH`s, if means that there is a problem.

You can do the following:

- Check if the mouse clicks are in the correct position
- Check if something is blocking the clicks
- Check if the APP is not responding
- etc.
