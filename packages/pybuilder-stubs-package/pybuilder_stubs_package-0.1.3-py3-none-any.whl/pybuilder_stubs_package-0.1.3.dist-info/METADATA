This plugin adds stubs_publish and stubs_upload tasks that you can use in your
build script.

Using MyPy's stubgen it creates type hinting stubs (``*.pyi`` files) as a separate
package. This stubs-only package is named with the ``stubs`` suffix following PEP
561. For a pybuilder project foo this would create stubs-only package foo-stubs.
