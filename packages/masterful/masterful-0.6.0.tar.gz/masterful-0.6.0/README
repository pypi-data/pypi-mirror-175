Masterful is the training platform for computer vision models. 

Pass in your model architecture and data. Masterful figures out the right hyperparameters for its SOTA regularization, optimization, and semi-supervised learning engines. And then trains your model weights to the peak accuracy. 

## Features
- Built on Tensorflow 2.
- SOTA regularization implementation to improve accuracy from your existing labeled training data while pushing all computations to GPU. 
- SOTA semi-supervised learning implementation to improve accuracy from your raw, unlabeled images. 
- Automatic, high speed hyperparameter discovery algorithms, based on custom search algorithms and analytical / closed-form solutions, to reduce manual experimentation. 
- Maximum GPU utilization and minimium GPU-hours used. 
- Support for most computer vision tasks:
    - Binary classification
    - Single-label classification
    - Multi-label classifcation
    - Detection
    - Semantic Segmentation
    - Instance Segmentation (coming soon)
    - Keypoint Detection (coming soon)
