# QP solvers benchmark

[![Contributing](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Benchmark for quadratic programming (QP) solvers available in Python. It contains the following test sets:

- [Maros-Meszaros](#maros-meszaros): problems designed to be difficult, some of them with non-strictly p.s.d. Hessians.
- [Maros-Meszaros dense](#maros-meszaros-dense): subset of the 59 smallest Maros-Meszaros problems, still difficult but accessible to dense solvers.

This benchmark aims to help us compare and select QP solvers. Its methodology is open to [discussions](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/discussions). New test sets are [also welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md). Feel free to add one that better represents the family of problems you are working on.

## Results

Check out the full reports for each test set in the [results](results) directory.

### Maros-Meszaros

The Maros-Meszaros test set contains difficult problems, some of them large, sparse, ill-conditioned or with non-strictly p.s.d. Hessian matrices. For sparse solvers only.

| Solver | Success rate (%) | Runtime (Ã— slower than best) | Primal error |
|:-------|-----------------:|-----------------------------:|-------------:|
| cvxopt | 16 | 16.4 |  18.5 |
| highs  | 61 |  1.8 |   2.0 |
| osqp   | 64 |  1.3 |   1.8 |
| proxqp | 72 |  1.0 |   1.0 |
| scs    | 54 |  3.1 | 548.2 |

Check out the [full report](results/maros_meszaros.md) for definitions and details.

### Maros-Meszaros dense

Probems in the Maros-Meszaros test set with less than a 1,000 optimization variables and 1,000 constraints. Note that this subset is not representative of the full Maros-Meszaros test set.

## Limitations

Here are some known areas of improvement for this benchmark:

- Cold start only: we don't evaluate warm-start performance for now.
- Dual feasibility: we don't check the dual multipliers that solvers compute internally, as the API for them is not yet unified.

## Running the benchmark

First, install the benchmark and QP solvers by:

```console
pip install qpsolvers_benchmark[solvers]
```

Omit ``[solvers]`` if you are only interested in running the benchmark with the solvers already installed on your system. Then, to run for instance the Maros-Meszaros test set, call:

```console
python benchmark.py run maros_meszaros
```

Replace ``maros_meszaros`` with the name of the test set you want to run. You can also run a specific solver, problem or set of solver settings:

```console
python benchmark.py run maros_meszaros_dense --solver proxqp --settings default
```

Check out ``python benchmark.py --help`` for details.
