        That is, the archive is stopped before all archivable records have been
        archived. Specifically, the problematic state is when a single instance
        becomes partially archived (example: 'instance_extra' record for one
        instance has been archived while its 'instances' record remains). Any
        access of the instance (example: listing deleted instances) that
        triggers the retrieval of a dependent record that has been archived
        away, results in undefined behavior that may raise an error.

        We will force the system into a state where a single deleted instance
        is partially archived. We want to verify that we can, for example,
        successfully do a GET /servers/detail at any point between partial
        archive_deleted_rows runs without errors.
