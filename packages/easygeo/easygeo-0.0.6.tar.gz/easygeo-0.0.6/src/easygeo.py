# Wrapper for geocoding api's, previous results are cached.
class GeoCode(object):
    """
    Wrapper for geopy's geocoding library,
    It simplifies the process of geocoding into two simple steps:
    1. Initialization (class instance creation)
    2. Geocoding (built in method within the class to transform an address into coordinates)

    This class has some perks such as a simple cache that can be used
    to avoid repetition of API calls into expensive services such as Google API, or just to improve speed.
    It has been tested with a cache size of around 6M unique addresses, which just work.
    Some optimization can be made, but if ain't broken don't fix it.
    (unless for some strange reason this becomes like the backbone of the internet, from which I'm sure 
    people far more versed coding will have their eyes bleed out first, and then try to improve on this c:)
