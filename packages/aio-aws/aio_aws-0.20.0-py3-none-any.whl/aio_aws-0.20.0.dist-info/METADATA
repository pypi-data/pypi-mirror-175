Asynchronous functions and tools for AWS services.  There is a
limited focus on s3 and AWS Batch and Lambda.  Additional services could be
added, but this project is likely to retain a limited focus.
For general client solutions, see
[aioboto3](https://github.com/terrycain/aioboto3) and
[aiobotocore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore), which wrap
[botocore](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)

The API documentation is at [readthedocs](https://aio-aws.readthedocs.io/)

# Install

This project has a very limited focus.  For general client solutions, see
[aioboto3](https://github.com/terrycain/aioboto3) and
[aiobotocore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore), which wrap
[botocore](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
to patch it with features for async coroutines using
[aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

This project is alpha-status with a 0.x.y API version that could break.
There is no promise to support or develop it extensively, at this time.

## pip

```shell
pip install -U aio-aws[all]
pip check  # pip might not guarantee consistent packages
```

## poetry

poetry will try to guarantee consistent packages or fail.

```shell
# with optional extras
poetry add aio-aws --extras all
```

```toml
# pyproject.toml snippet

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.7"

# with optional extras
aio-aws = {version = "^0.1.0", extras = ["all"]}

# or, to make it an optional extra
aio-aws = {version = "^0.1.0", extras = ["all"], optional = true}
[tool.poetry.extras]
aio-aws = ["aio-aws"]

```

# Contributing

To use the source code, it can be cloned directly. To
contribute to the project, first fork it and clone the forked repository.

The following setup assumes that
[miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are installed already
(and `make` 4.x).

- https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
    - recommended for creating virtual environments with required versions of python
    - see https://github.com/dazza-codes/conda_container/blob/master/conda_venv.sh
- https://python-poetry.org/docs/
    - recommended for managing a python project with pip dependencies for
      both the project itself and development dependencies

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dazza-codes/aio-aws
cd aio-aws
conda create -n aio-aws python=3.7
conda activate aio-aws
make init  # calls poetry install
make test
```
