# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.5.6

## New features

- Implemented an analysis for obtaining UMAP embeddings from a gene expression matrix. It is
 found in  ```cell2cell.external.umap.run_umap()```.
- Implemented UMAP biplot to visualize UMAP embeddings. It is found in 
 ```cell2cell.plotting.umap_plot.umap_biplot()```
- Implemented functions to subset an InteractionTensor by lists of names of the elements in any
 of the tensor dimensions.
    - Function ```cell2cell.tensor.subset.subset_tensor()``` to subset an InteractionTensor,
      powered by the function ```cell2cell.tensor.subset.find_element_indexes()``` to find
      where each element name is located in the tensor.
    - Function ```cell2cell.tensor.subset.subset_metadata()``` to subset the metadata generated with
      ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.generate_tensor_metadata()```. It makes the metadata to contain only elements
      contained in an InteractionTensor of reference.
