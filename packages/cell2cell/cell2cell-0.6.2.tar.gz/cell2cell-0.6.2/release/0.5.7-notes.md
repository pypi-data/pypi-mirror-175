# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.5.7

## New features

- Added geometric mean as a communication score in ```cell2cell.core.communication_scores```
- Added the parameter ```var_ordered_factors``` in
 ```cell2cell.tensor.BaseTensor.compute_factorization()``` to decide whether reordering
 the factors by the variance they explain (in a descending order).
- Made the parameter ```normalize_loadings=True``` as default in
 ```cell2cell.tensor.BaseTensor.compute_factorization()```
- Added an option to plot the loadings of a tensor factorization directly from a
factors object (an OrderedDict usually found in ```cell2cell.tensor.BaseTensor.factors```).
It can be done with the function ```cell2cell.plotting.tensor_factors_plot_from_loadings()```
- To complement the previous point, added a function to import factors from an Excel file
previously exported with ```cell2cell.tensor.BaseTensor.export_factors(filename)```. To import the
factors, use ```cell2cell.io.load_tensor_factors(filename)```.

## Fixed Bugs

- Fixed minor bugs in functions ```cell2cell.external.umap.run_umap()``` and
```cell2cell.plotting.umap_plot.umap_biplot()```
