# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.5.8

## New features
- Implemented communication score 'expression_gmean' in all pipelines of cell2cell (cell2cell.analysis.pipelines)
- Updated documentation of regular cell2cell
- Implemented **downstream analyses for Tensor-cell2cell**, available in ```cell2cell.analysis.tensor_downstream``` and
 associated plots in ```cell2cell.plotting.factor_plot```
- Implemented the **CorrIndex metric** to compare two tensor decompositions of similar tensors, available in
```cell2cell.tensor.metrics```
- Implemented a function to export networks to be read in Cytoscape. It can be called as
```cell2cell.utils.networks.export_network_to_cytoscape()```
- Renamed ```cell2cell.plotting.dot_plot.py``` into ```cell2cell.plotting.pval_plot.py``` and included a new function
to perform the dot plots with any input. The original function is ```cell2cell.plotting.pval_plot.dot_plot()```, which
takes a ```cell2cell.analysis.pipelines.SingleCellInteractions``` object, while the new function is
```cell2cell.plotting.pval_plot.generate_dot_plot()```, which takes any pair of dataframes of P-values and scores.

## Fixed Bugs
- Fixed bugs in triangular clustermap in ```cell2cell.plotting.cci_plot``` 
- Fixed bug associated with duplicated gene names when building a ```cell2cell.tensor.InteractionTensor```

## Dependency Update
- Added statannotations
