# MaxConsole 0.4.0

<span style="color:#00ff00;">Changed project formatter to Black.
## New in 0.3.0:

Added rich tracebacks to the custom rich console that MacConsole generates.


## Purpose


MaxConsole is a simple wrapper on top of Rich's Console class that allows you to easily create a console with a custom theme.

## Installation

### Pip

```bash
pip install maxconsole
```

### Pipx (recommended)

```bash
pipx install maxconsole
```

### Poetry

```bash
poetry add maxconsole
```

## Usage
```python
from maxconsole import get_console

console = get_console() # It's that easy.
```

## Customization

Making your own theme isn't hard but it's nice to have one spelled out for you, without lifting a finger.
