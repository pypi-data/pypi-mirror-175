## Installation

`font-size` requires a Python 3.6+ interpreter and runs on Linux distros, macOS, and Windows.

Installation in a [Python3 virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended as dependencies are pinned to versions that are confirmed to work with this project.

Use any of the following installation approaches:

### pip install from PyPI

```
$ pip3 install font-size
```

### pip install from source

```
$ git clone https://github.com/source-foundry/font-size.git
$ cd font-size
$ pip3 install .
```

### Developer install from source

The following approach installs the project and associated optional developer dependencies so that source changes are available without the need for re-installation.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/source-foundry/font-size.git
$ cd font-size
$ pip3 install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

```
$ font-size [FONT PATH 1] [FONT PATH 2] ... [FONT PATH ...]
```

## Issues

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A development dependency environment can be installed in editable mode with the developer installation documentation above.

Please use the standard Github pull request approach to propose source changes.

### Source file linting

Python source files are linted with `flake8`. See the Makefile `test-lint` target for details.


### Testing

The project runs continuous integration testing on GitHub Actions runners with the `pytest` testing toolchain. Test modules are located in the `tests` directory of the repository.

Local testing by Python interpreter version can be performed with the following command executed from the root of the repository:

```
$ tox -e [PYTHON INTERPRETER VERSION]
```

Please see the `tox` documentation for additional details.

### Test coverage
