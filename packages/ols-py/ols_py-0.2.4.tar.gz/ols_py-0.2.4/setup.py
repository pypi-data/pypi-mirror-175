The documentation is updated and published as a [Github project page\n ](https://pages.github.com/) automatically as part each release.\n\n### Releasing\n\nTrigger the [Draft release workflow](https://github.com/ahida-development/ols-py/actions/workflows/draft_release.yml)\n(press _Run workflow_). This will update the changelog & version and create a GitHub release which is in _Draft_ state.\n\nFind the draft release from the\n[GitHub releases](https://github.com/ahida-development/ols-py/releases) and publish it. When\n a release is published, it'll trigger [release](https://github.com/ahida-development/ols-py/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow which creates PyPI\n release and deploys updated documentation.\n\n### Pre-commit\n\nPre-commit hooks run all the auto-formatters (e.g. `black`, `isort`), linters (e.g. `mypy`, `flake8`), and other quality\n checks to make sure the changeset is in good shape before a commit/push happens.\n\nYou can install the hooks with (runs for each commit):\n\n```sh\npre-commit install\n```\n\nOr if you want them to run only for each push:\n\n```sh\npre-commit install -t pre-push\n```\n\nOr if you want e.g. want to run all checks manually for all files:\n\n```sh\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\n---\n\nThis project was generated using the [wolt-python-package-cookiecutter](https://github.com/woltapp/wolt-python-package-cookiecutter) template.\n",
