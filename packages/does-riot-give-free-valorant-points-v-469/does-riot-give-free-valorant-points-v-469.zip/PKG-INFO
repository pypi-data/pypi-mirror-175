================================================

One of the most popular methods to acquire free Valorant points is to purchase them in-game. This is the easiest and quickest way to unlock all the agents in the game, but it comes at a cost. However, if you’d rather pay a few dollars and unlock all the agents in the game, you should consider buying them. It’s important to note, though, that you cannot buy these points in-game. You can, however, earn them through challenges, contracts, and missions.

Valorant releases a Battle pass every new Act. And while there is no guarantee which guns will be in the battle pass, it always gives you around 9 to 12 gun skins. These skins come in sets of 3. So there is a good chance you will get a Spectre skin. But the catch of a battle pass is just buying the battle pass won’t get you the Spectre skin. You will have to grind to earn the XP needed to reach the tier where you can unlock the Spectre skin. So to sum it up.
