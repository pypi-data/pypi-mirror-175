This has been tested only on Windows 11 64-bit.

## Installations

`pip install mext`

Important Steps:
- Have Chrome browser installed, download chromedriver matching your Chrome browser version.
- Add chromedriver location to PATH environment variable.


## Usage

This package uses multiple provider codes to extract manga/manhua/manhwa data from online sites.

The providers and it's usage is listed below.

It's easy to use from python code.

**Steps:**
1. Import `Mext` like this

   `from mext import Mext`

2. Get the URL of manga or chapter and pass it to `Mext`

  ```python
  manga_url = 'xxx1'
  chapter_url = 'xxx2'

  # Initialize
  me = Mext()

  # To get manga
  me.populate(['manga'], manga_url)
  manga = me.manga

  # To get one particular chapter
  me.populate(['chapter'], chapter_url)
  chapter = me.chapter

  # Pass manga url to get chapter list belonging to manga
  me.populate(['chapter_list'], manga_url)
  chapters = me.chapter_list

  # Pass manga url when you need both manga and chapter
  me.populate(['manga', 'chapter_list'], manga_url)
  manga = me.manga
  chapters = me.chapter_list
  ```

  If you are using Mext for one time data collection you could pass the arguments given to `populate` to `Mext` directly at initialization.
