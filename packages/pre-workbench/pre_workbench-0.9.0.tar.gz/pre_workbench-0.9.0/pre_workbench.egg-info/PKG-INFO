# Protocol Reverse Engineering Workbench

PRE Workbench is a software to support researchers in reverse engineering protocols 
and documenting the results.
It supports various sources to import protocol traffic from, helps the
discovery process by displaying different views and heuristic-based 
highlighting on data, and aids in documenting and sharing findings.
