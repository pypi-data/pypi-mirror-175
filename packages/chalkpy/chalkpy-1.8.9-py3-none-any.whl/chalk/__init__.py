    :param fn: The function that you're decorating as a resolver.

    :param environment: Environments are used to trigger behavior
        in different deployments such as staging, production, and
        local development. For example, you may wish to interact with
        a vendor via an API call in the production environment, and
        opt to return a constant value in a staging environment.

        Environment can take one of three types:

            - None (default) - candidate to run in every environment
            - str - run only in this environment
            - list[str] - run in any of the specified environment and no others

    :param tags: Tags allow you to scope requests within an
        environment. Both tags and environment need to match for a
        resolver to be a candidate to execute.

        You might consider using tags, for example, to change out
        whether you want to use a sandbox environment for a vendor,
        or to bypass the vendor and return constant values in a
        staging environment.

    :param cron: You can schedule resolvers to run on a
        pre-determined schedule via the cron argument to resolver
        decorators.

        Cron can sample all examples, a subset of all examples,
        or a custom provided set of examples.

        Read more at https://docs.chalk.ai/docs/resolver-cron

    :param machine_type: You can optionally specify that resolvers
        need to run on a machine other than the default. Must be
        configured in your deployment.

    :param when: Like tags, `when` can filter when a resolver
        is eligible to run. Unlike tags, `when` can use feature values,
        so that you can write resolvers like:

            @realtime(when=User.risk_profile == "low" or User.is_employee)
            def resolver_fn(...) -> ...:
                ...

    :return: A callable function! You can unit test resolvers
        as you would unit test any other code.
