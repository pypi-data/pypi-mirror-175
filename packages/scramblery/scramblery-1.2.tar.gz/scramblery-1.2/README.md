A simple tool to scramble your images or only faces from images or videos. You can find the online demo in javascript [here](https://altunenes.github.io/scramblery/scramblerydemo.html). For more information, please visit the [documentation](https://altunenes.github.io/scramblery/).

#### Purpose of Package

The purpose of this package is the creating scrambled images from images or videos. User can either scramble the whole image or only facial area.
This is very useful tool in psychology experiments especially if you are working with faces. With a for loop you can scramble all the images in a folder and create a new folder with scrambled images. It was very long process to scramble images manually in the past and I feel like this package can be useful for many people. Hope this package will be useful for your research.
