## Typing stubs for keyboard

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `keyboard` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `keyboard`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/keyboard. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `e68567a1b44bf511431b4caf5fb698c3edf82c7c`.
