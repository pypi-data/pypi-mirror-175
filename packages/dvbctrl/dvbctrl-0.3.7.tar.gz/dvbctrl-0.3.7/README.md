# dvbctrl

Module to control a local [dvbstreamer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvbstreamer/).  On Arch you can install dvbstreamer from
the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dvbstreamer).

## starting

```python
from dvbctrl.dvbstreamer import DVBStreamer

adapter = 0
dvbs = DVBStreamer(adapter)
running = dvbs.start()
if not running:
    raise Exception(f"Failed to start dvbstreamer on adapter {adapter}")
```

## stopping

```python
from dvbctrl.dvbstreamer import DVBStreamer

adapter = 0
dvbs = DVBStreamer(adapter)

...

if dvbs.isRunning():
    dvbs.stop()
```

## commands

```python
from dvbctrl.commands import DVBCommand

kwargs = {
    "adapter": 0,
    "host": "127.0.0.1"
    "pass": "dvbctrl"
    "user": "dvbctrl"
}
dvbc = DVBCommand(**kwargs)

# services (channels)
chans = dvbc.lsservices()
```

## ad-hoc commands

1. tuneToChannel() - Tunes the dvbstreamer to a channel
                     will wait up to 5 seconds for dvbstreamer to stabilise
                     Returns True if tuned or False otherwise
1. isTuned()       - returns True if tuned, False otherwise
1. waitTuned()     - waits for up to 5 seconds for the streamer to tune
                     returns True if tuned successfully, False otherwise
