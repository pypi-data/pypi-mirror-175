    """The bulk of the logic in the sensor is in this function. At the end of the function we return a
    dictionary that maps each asset to a Tuple. The Tuple contains a boolean, indicating if the asset
    has materialized or will materialize, and a tuple(float, int) representing the timestamp and storage id
    the parent asset would update the cursor to if it is the most recent materialization of a parent asset.
    In some cases we set the tuple to (0.0, 0) so that the tuples of other parent materializations will take precedent.

    Args:
        current_asset: We want to determine if this asset should materialize, so we gather information about
            if its parents have materialized.
        parent_assets: the parents of current_asset.
        cursor_tuple: In the cursor for the sensor we store the timestamp and storage id of the most recent materialization
            of current_asset's parents. This allows us to see if any of the parents have been materialized
            more recently.
        will_materialize_set: A set of all of the assets the sensor has already determined it will materialize.
            We check if the parent assets are in this list when determining their materialization status
        wait_for_in_progress_runs: If the user wants the sensor to wait for in progress runs of parent
            assets to complete before materializing current_asset.

    Here's how we get there:

    We want to get the materialization information for all of the parents of an asset to determine
    if we want to materialize the asset in this sensor tick. We also need determine the new cursor
    value for the asset so that we don't process the same materialization events for the parent
    assets again.

    We iterate through each parent of the asset and determine its materialization info. The parent
    asset's materialization status can be one of three options:
    1. The parent has materialized since the last time the child was materialized.
    2. The parent is slated to be materialized (i.e. included in will_materialize_set)
    3. The parent has not been materialized and will not be materialized by the sensor.

    In cases 1 and 2 we indicate that the parent has been updated by setting its value in
    parent_asset_event_records to True. For case 3 we set its value to False.

    If wait_for_in_progress_runs=True, there is another condition we want to check for.
    If any of the parents is currently being materialized we want to wait to materialize current_asset
    until the parent materialization is complete so that the asset can have the most up to date data.
    So, for each parent asset we check if it has a planned asset materialization event in a run that
    is currently in progress. If this is the case, we don't want current_asset to materialize, so we
    set parent_asset_event_records to False for all parents (so that if the sensor is set to
    materialize if any of the parents are updated, the sensor will still choose to not materialize
    the asset) and immediately return.

    Returns:
        A MultiAssetSensorDefinition that will monitor the parents of the provided assets to determine when
        the provided assets should be materialized

    Example:
        If you have the following asset graph:

        .. code-block:: python

            a       b       c
             \     / \     /

                 \     /
                    f

        and create the sensor:

        .. code-block:: python

            build_asset_reconciliation_sensor(
                AssetSelection.assets(d, e, f),

                wait_for_in_progress_runs=True
            )

        You will observe the following behavior:
            * If ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` are all materialized, then on the next sensor tick, the sensor will see that ``d`` and ``e`` can
              be materialized. Since ``d`` and ``e`` will be materialized, ``f`` can also be materialized. The sensor will kick off a
              run that will materialize ``d``, ``e``, and ``f``.
            * If on the next sensor tick, ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` have not been materialized again the sensor will not launch a run.
            * If before the next sensor tick, just asset ``a`` and ``b`` have been materialized, the sensor will launch a run to
              materialize ``d``.
            * If asset ``c`` is materialized by the next sensor tick, the sensor will see that ``e`` can be materialized (since ``b`` and
              ``c`` have both been materialized since the last materialization of ``e``). The sensor will also see that ``f`` can be materialized
              since ``d`` was updated in the previous sensor tick and ``e`` will be materialized by the sensor. The sensor will launch a run
              the materialize ``e`` and ``f``.
            * If by the next sensor tick, only asset ``b`` has been materialized. The sensor will not launch a run since ``d`` and ``e`` both have
              a parent that has not been updated.
            * If during the next sensor tick, there is a materialization of ``a`` in progress, the sensor will not launch a run to
              materialize ``d``. Once ``a`` has completed materialization, the next sensor tick will launch a run to materialize ``d``.

        **Other considerations:**
            If an asset has a SourceAsset as a parent, and that source asset points to an external data source (ie the
            source asset does not point to an asset in another repository), the sensor will not know when to consider
            the source asset "materialized". If you have the asset graph:

            .. code-block:: python

                x   external_data_source
                 \       /
                     y

            and create the sensor:

            .. code-block:: python

                build_asset_reconciliation_sensor(
                    AssetSelection.assets(y),
                    name="my_reconciliation_sensor",
                    wait_for_all_upstream=True,
                    wait_for_in_progress_runs=True
                )

            ``y`` will never be updated because ``external_data_source`` is never considered "materialized. In this case you should create the
            sensor

            .. code-block:: python

                build_asset_reconciliation_sensor(
                    AssetSelection.assets(y),
                    name="my_reconciliation_sensor",
                    wait_for_all_upstream=False,
                    wait_for_in_progress_runs=True
                )

            which will cause ``y`` to be materialized when ``x`` is materialized.
