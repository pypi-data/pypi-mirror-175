This is a library and command-line tool for converting Markdown files with pipe tables to Markdown files with grid 
tables. Both the pipe tables and the grid tables must be compatible with 
[Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). 
(This notably supports tables formatted for github-flavored markdown.)
