# Graph data file(s) from an aranet4 sensor

The `aranet4-graph` (python) program takes a YAML input file for
configuration that allows loading and graphing of a CSV file that has
been exported from the aranet4 phone app.  The YAML configuration
supports specifying the `file` to load, `begin` and `end` timestamps
to limit the graph to and a set of `markers` for having arrows that
point at the graph.  Each marker can be a simple string, or may be a
dictionary and a `label` and a `offset` that sets the vertical offset
of the label and arrow length.  The default offset is 400.

Example:

``` yaml
input:  2022-11-05-smf-to-lhr.csv
output: 2022-11-05-smf-to-lhr.png
begin: "2022-11-04 08:23 PDT"
markers:
       "2022-11-04 09:00 PDT": "at home"
       "2022-11-04 11:30 PDT": "SMF gate"
       "2022-11-04 12:20 PDT":
         label: "boarding"
         offset: 600
       "2022-11-04 13:05 PDT":
         label: "taking off"
         offset: -200
       "2022-11-04 13:55 PDT": "in flight"
       "2022-11-04 16:14 MDT": "landing"
       "2022-11-04 16:45 MDT": "DEN United club"
       "2022-11-04 17:45 MDT": "at next gate"
end:   "2022-11-04 18:45 MDT"
```
