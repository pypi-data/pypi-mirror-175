Description: # tomspdb
        
        My version of Python's pdb debugger pdb with convenience functions.
        
        # Features
        
        * Jump to my code and out of library code (`my`)
        * Go to top and bottom of the stack (`top` and `bottom`).
        * Interact with pdb object directly (`get_pdb`) useful for customizing pdb
        * Interact with the frame object (`get_frame`). You can use this to look at my code
        * Exclude directories from `where` to make the output more readable (`pretty_where` or `where`)
        
        # Using
        
        ```
        pip install tomspdb
        python3 -m tomspdb script.py
        ```
        
        # Prior work
        
        * [This blog post](https://maurcz.github.io/posts/002-customizing-the-python-debugger/) by Mauricio R. Cruz . I found this code sample very useful
        * [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/) and [pdbpp](https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/) are more useful alternatives to pdb
