Otter comes with a few built-in plugins to optionally extend its own functionality. These plugins 
are documented here. **Note:** To use these plugins, specify the importable names *exactly* as seen 
here (i.e. ``otter.plugins.builtin.GoogleSheetsGradeOverride``, not 
``otter.plugins.builtin.grade_override.GoogleSheetsGradeOverride``).
