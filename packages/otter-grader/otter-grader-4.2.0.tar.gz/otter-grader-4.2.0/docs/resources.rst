Here are some resources and examples for using Otter-Grader:

* `Some demos for using Otter + R <https://github.com/ucbds-infra/ottr-sample>`_ that demonstrate 
  how to autograde R scripts, R Jupyter notebooks, and Rmd files, including how to use Otter Assign 
  on the latter two formats.
* `A quickstart guide to autograding R with Otter 
  <https://econ140-spring2020.shinyapps.io/otter_quickstart/>`_
