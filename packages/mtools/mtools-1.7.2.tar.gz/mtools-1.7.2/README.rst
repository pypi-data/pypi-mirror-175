**mtools** is a collection of helper scripts to parse, filter, and visualize
MongoDB log files (``mongod``, ``mongos``). mtools also includes ``mlaunch``, a
utility to quickly set up complex MongoDB test environments on a local machine,
and ``mtransfer``, a tool for transferring databases between MongoDB instances.

Requirements and Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------

The mtools collection is written in Python, and most of the tools only use the
standard packages shipped with Python. The tools are currently tested with
Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

Some of the tools have additional dependencies, which are listed under the
specific tool's section. See the `installation instructions
<https://rueckstiess.github.io/mtools/install.html>`__ for more information.

The mtools suite is only tested with actively supported (non End-of-Life)
versions of the MongoDB server. As of October 2022, that includes
MongoDB 4.2 or newer.

NOTE: logv2 format (MongoDB 4.4+) is not fully supported yet.
