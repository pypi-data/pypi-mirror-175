        ## About
        
        Django module meant to allow django users to keep a history of their previously used passwords.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Follow these instructions to install and setup django-password-history in your django project.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        The only prerequisites to installing django-password-history is having django 2 installed in a Python 3 environment.
        
        ### Installing
        
        The installation process for django password history is very simple. Start by running the following command to install the package.
        
        ```
        pip install django-password-history
        ```
        
        
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
        
        ## Running Tests
        
        The test suite for this package is a work in progress. The initial sample test can be run by using the following command.
        
        ```
        coverage run --source django_password_history runtests.py
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        In order to use the system you must add django_password_history to your installed apps in your settings.py file.
        
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            'django_password_history'
        ]
        ```
        
        Next you need to define how many historical passwords you want to compare on to the new password when a password is chanced. The default and max is 5 previous passwords.
        
        ```
        PREVIOUS_PASSWORD_COUNT = 3
        ```
        
        THe UserPasswordHistory has a one to one relationship with your user model as defined in your settings.py file.
        
        ```
        AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"
        ```
        
        To import the UserPasswordHistory model add the following to the top of the desired python file.
        
        ```
        from django_password_history.models import UserPasswordHistory
        ```
