## About

Django module meant to allow django users to keep a history of their previously used passwords.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to install and setup django-password-history in your django project.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisites to installing django-password-history is having django 2 installed in a Python 3 environment.

### Installing

The installation process for django password history is very simple. Start by running the following command to install the package.

```
pip install django-password-history
```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running Tests

The test suite for this package is a work in progress. The initial sample test can be run by using the following command.

```
coverage run --source django_password_history runtests.py
```


## Usage

In order to use the system you must add django_password_history to your installed apps in your settings.py file.

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django_password_history'
]
```

Next you need to define how many historical passwords you want to compare on to the new password when a password is chanced. The default and max is 5 previous passwords.

```
PREVIOUS_PASSWORD_COUNT = 3
```

THe UserPasswordHistory has a one to one relationship with your user model as defined in your settings.py file.

```
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"
```

To import the UserPasswordHistory model add the following to the top of the desired python file.

```
from django_password_history.models import UserPasswordHistory
```
