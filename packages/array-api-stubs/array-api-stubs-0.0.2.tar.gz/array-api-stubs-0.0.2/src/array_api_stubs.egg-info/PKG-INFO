# Stubs for the array API standard

Documentation specific to singular Python objects in the spec (i.e. functions,
methods and attributes) are infact represented by stub objects in the package
`array-api-stubs`. These stubs ultimately get rendered via the autodoc
capabilities in Sphinx.

TODO: describe how `array-api-stubs` can be used for tooling, once it actually
has the capacity to do so.
