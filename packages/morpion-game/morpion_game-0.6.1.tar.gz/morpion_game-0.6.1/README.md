## installation
You can install the package by running the following command : ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade morpion-game``` 

### Setup
The first time you play, you will be prompted for your favorite language.
Currently, the available languages are :
- English
- French

Once done, you can start playing !

### install the GUI
The CUI application can be installed directly from the package. You just have to run it with the `--gui` argument.
This will launch the GUI application if installed (and found on your system), else it will run the installer program.

#### Notes
The CLI and teh GUI applications' datas are shared.
These datas are **only** stored on your local machine and will never be publish or send because of the game.
You can access datas in your personal directory `C:\Users\username\PetchouDev\datas.json`. *but do not edit them... I should encrypt them in a next version...*
You can delete datas from any of the two applications from the **settings** menu.
