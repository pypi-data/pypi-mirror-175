Experiment-Scheduler is open-source, for automating repeated experiments.
In some environments like where k8s is not supported, where you can only use is ssh servers with python, repeatedly running same experiments with different parameters would be annoying and boring.
By minimum settings and minimum effort, we provide distributed multi-experiment environment without affecting your already-completed server setting.
Our goal is make you only concentrate on experiment by providing easily, fastly constructable experiment tool.
