This is an optimal pricing model and loan allotment model based on ROI.

There are two functions within, one for each model.

calc_new_prod_price(var_cost_list, max_qty, max_price, fixed_cost, profit_margin)

This function has to be called for determining the optimal price of a new product entering the market.
It takes the following arguments:

var_cost_list : (compulsory) Takes a list of variable cost inputs per unit of product.

max_qty : (compulsory) Takes an integer input of the maximum quantity that can be produced of the product.

max_price : (compulsory) Takes a numeric input of the maximum price that can be set for the product
based on precedent or industry standards.

fixed_cost : (compulsory) Takes a numeric input of the fixed costs incurred while producing the product
regardless of the quantity produced.

profit_margin : (optional) Takes a numeric input and allows the user to provide their desired profit margins for
optimal pricing. In case it is left blank, a default profit margin will be calculated via mathematical formulas.


loan_alloc(total_fund, percent_alloc, i, signs)

This function has to be called for estimating the loan allotment for each category.
The function takes the following arguments:

total_fund: (Compulsory) Takes a numeric input of the total fund that the bank has available for loan allotment. 

percent_alloc: (Compulsory) Takes a list input of numeric data for the percentage of the total fund allotted to each loan category. 

i: (Compulsory) Takes a list input of numeric data for the Rate of Interest associated with each loan category.

signs: (Compulsory) Takes a list input of string type for the sign of the constraint i.e. â€œ<=â€œ or â€œ>=â€œ
