    "text": "Non-canonical NRF2 activation promotes a pro-diabetic shift in hepatic glucose metabolism\n\nOBJECTIVE: NRF2, a transcription factor that regulates cellular redox and metabolic homeostasis, plays a dual role in human disease. While it is well known that canonical intermittent NRF2 activation protects against diabetes-induced tissue damage, little is known regarding the effects of prolonged non-canonical NRF2 activation in diabetes. The goal of this study was to determine the role and mechanisms of prolonged NRF2 activation in arsenic diabetogenicity.\nMETHODS: To test this, we utilized an integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic approach to assess diabetogenic changes in the livers of wild type, Nrf2-/-, p62-/-, or Nrf2-/-; p62-/- mice exposed to arsenic in the drinking water for 20 weeks.\nRESULTS: In contrast to canonical oxidative/electrophilic activation, prolonged non-canonical NRF2 activation via p62-mediated sequestration of KEAP1 increases carbohydrate flux through the polyol pathway, resulting in a pro-diabetic shift in glucose homeostasis. This p62- and NRF2-dependent increase in liver fructose metabolism and gluconeogenesis occurs through the upregulation of four novel NRF2 target genes, ketohexokinase (Khk), sorbitol dehydrogenase (Sord), triokinase/FMN cyclase (Tkfc), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4A).\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that NRF2 and p62 are essential for arsenic-mediated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, revealing a pro-diabetic role for prolonged NRF2 activation in arsenic diabetogenesis.",

    "text": "Excessive Intake of High-Fructose Corn Syrup Drinks Induces Impaired Glucose Tolerance\n\nThe number of patients with diabetes was approximately 463 million worldwide in 2019, with almost 57.6% of this population concentrated in Asia. Asians often develop type 2 diabetes (T2D), even if they are underweight and consume a smaller amount of food. Soft drinks contain large amounts of sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Excessive intake of HFCS drinks is considered to be one of the causes of T2D. In the present study, we investigated the effect of excessive consumption of HFCS-water on glucose tolerance and obesity under conditions of controlled caloric intake using a mouse model. Three-week-old male ICR mice were divided into two groups and given free access to 10% HFCS-water or deionized water. The caloric intake was adjusted to be the same in both groups using a standard rodent diet. The excess HFCS-water intake did not lead to obesity, but led to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) due to insulin-secretion defect. It affected glucose and fructose metabolism; for example, it decreased the expression of glucokinases, ketohexokinase, and glucose transporter 2 in the pancreas. These results suggest that excessive consumption of HFCS drinks, such as soft drinks, without a proper diet, induces nonobese IGT due to insulin-secretion defect.",

    "text": "Grape Polyphenols Attenuate Diet-Induced Obesity and Hepatic Steatosis in Mice in Association With Reduced Butyrate and Increased Markers of Intestinal Carbohydrate Oxidation\n\nA Western Diet (WD) low in fiber but high in fats and sugars contributes to obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Supplementation with grape polyphenols (GPs) rich in B-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) can attenuate symptoms of cardiometabolic disease and alter the gut microbiota and its metabolites. We hypothesized that GP-mediated metabolic improvements would correlate with altered microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). To more closely mimic a WD, C57BL/6J male mice were fed a low-fiber diet high in sucrose and butterfat along with 20% sucrose water to represent sugary beverages. This WD was supplemented with 1% GPs (WD-GP) to investigate the impact of GPs on energy balance, SCFA profile, and intestinal metabolism. Compared to WD-fed mice, the WD-GP group had higher lean mass along with lower fat mass, body weight, and hepatic steatosis despite consuming more calories from sucrose water. Indirect and direct calorimetry revealed that reduced adiposity in GP-supplemented mice was likely due to their greater energy expenditure, which resulted in lower energy efficiency compared to WD-fed mice. GP-supplemented mice had higher abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut microbe reported to increase energy expenditure. Short chain fatty acid measurements in colon content revealed that GP-supplemented mice had lower concentrations of butyrate, a major energy substrate of the distal intestine, and reduced valerate, a putrefactive SCFA. GP-supplementation also resulted in a lower acetate:propionate ratio suggesting reduced hepatic lipogenesis. Considering the higher sucrose consumption and reduced butyrate levels in GP-supplemented mice, we hypothesized that enterocytes would metabolize glucose and fructose as a replacement energy source. Ileal mRNA levels of glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2, SLC2A2) were increased indicating higher glucose and fructose uptake. Expression of ketohexokinase (KHK) was increased in ileum tissue suggesting increased fructolysis. A GP-induced increase in intestinal carbohydrate oxidation was supported by: (1) increased gene expression of duodenal pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), (2) a decreased ratio of lactate dehydrogenase a (LDHa): LDHb in jejunum and colon tissues, and (3) decreased duodenal and colonic lactate concentrations. These data indicate that GPs protect against WD-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis by diminishing portal delivery of lipogenic butyrate and sugars due to their increased intestinal utilization.",

    "text": "IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation exacerbates high fructose-induced podocyte hypertrophy by ketohexokinase-A-mediated tristetraprolin down-regulation\n\nGlomerular hypertrophy is a crucial factor of severe podocyte damage and proteinuria. Our previous study showed that high fructose induced podocyte injury. The current study aimed to explore a novel molecular mechanism underlying podocyte hypertrophy induced by high fructose. Here we demonstrated for the first time that high fructose significantly initiated the hypertrophy in rat glomeruli and differentiated human podocytes (HPCs). Consistently, it induced inflammatory response with the down-regulation of anti-inflammatory factor zinc-finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP) and the activation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in these animal and cell models. Subsequently, high-expression of microRNA-92a-3p (miR-92a-3p) and its target protein cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 (P57) down-regulation, representing abnormal proliferation and apoptosis, were observed in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, high fructose increased ketohexokinase-A (KHK-A) expression in rat glomeruli and differentiated HPCs. Exogenous IL-6 stimulation up-regulated IL-6/STAT3 signaling and miR-92a-3p, reduced P57 expression and promoted podocyte proliferation, apoptosis and hypertrophy in vitro. The data from anti-inflammatory agent maslinic acid treatment or TTP siRNA transfection showed that high fructose may decrease TTP to activate IL-6/STAT3 signaling in podocyte overproliferation and apoptosis, causing podocyte hypertrophy. Whereas, KHK-A siRNA transfection remarkably restored high fructose-induced TTP down-regulation, IL-6/STAT3 signaling activation, podocyte overproliferation, apoptosis and hypertrophy in differentiated HPCs. Taken together, these results suggested that high fructose possibly increased KHK-A expression to down-regulate TTP, subsequently activated IL-6/STAT3 signaling to interfere with podocyte proliferation and apoptosis by up-regulating miR-92a-3p to suppress P57 expression, causing podocyte hypertrophy. Therefore, the inactivation of IL-6/STAT3 to relieve podocyte hypertrophy mediated by inhibiting KHK-A to increase TTP may be a novel strategy for high fructose diet-associated podocyte injury and proteinuria.",

    "text": "Non-hematopoietic IL-4Rα expression contributes to fructose-driven obesity and metabolic sequelae\n\nObjectiveThe risks of excess sugar intake in addition to high-fat diet consumption on immunopathogenesis of obesity-associated metabolic diseases are poorly defined. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 signaling via IL-4Rα regulates adipose tissue lipolysis, insulin sensitivity, and liver fibrosis in obesity. However, the contribution of IL-4Rα to sugar rich diet-driven obesity and metabolic sequelae remains unknown.MethodsWT, IL-4Rα-deficient (IL-4Rα−/−) and STAT6-deficient mice (STAT6−/−) male mice were fed low-fat chow, high fat (HF) or HF plus high carbohydrate (HC/fructose) diet (HF + HC). Analysis included quantification of: (i) body weight, adiposity, energy expenditure, fructose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation/synthesis, glucose dysmetabolism and hepatocellular damage; (ii) the contribution of the hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic IL-4Rα expression; and (iii) the relevance of IL-4Rα downstream canonical STAT6 signaling pathway in this setting.ResultsWe show that IL-4Rα regulated HF + HC diet-driven weight gain, whole body adiposity, adipose tissue inflammatory gene expression, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammatory gene expression and hepatocellular damage. These effects were potentially, and in part, dependent on non-hematopoietic IL-4Rα expression but were independent of direct STAT6 activation. Mechanistically, hepatic ketohexokinase-A and C expression was dependent on IL-4Rα, as it was reduced in IL-4Rα-deficient mice. KHK activity was also affected by HF + HC dietary challenge. Further, reduced expression/activity of KHK in IL-4Rα mice had a significant effect on fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid synthesis pathways.ConclusionOur findings highlight potential contribution of non-hematopoietic IL-4Rα activation of a non-canonical signaling pathway that regulates the HF + HC diet-driven induction of obesity and severity of obesity-associated sequelae.",

    "text": "Dietary fructose improves intestinal cell survival and nutrient absorption\n\nFructose consumption is linked to the rising incidence of obesity and cancer, which are two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally1,2. Dietary fructose metabolism begins at the epithelium of the small intestine, where fructose is transported by glucose transporter type 5 (GLUT5; encoded by SLC2A5) and phosphorylated by ketohexokinase to form fructose 1-phosphate, which accumulates to high levels in the cell3,4. Although this pathway has been implicated in obesity and tumour promotion, the exact mechanism that drives these pathologies in the intestine remains unclear. Here we show that dietary fructose improves the survival of intestinal cells and increases intestinal villus length in several mouse models. The increase in villus length expands the surface area of the gut and increases nutrient absorption and adiposity in mice that are fed a high-fat diet. In hypoxic intestinal cells, fructose 1-phosphate inhibits the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase to promote cell survival5–7. Genetic ablation of ketohexokinase or stimulation of pyruvate kinase prevents villus elongation and abolishes the nutrient absorption and tumour growth that are induced by feeding mice with high-fructose corn syrup. The ability of fructose to promote cell survival through an allosteric metabolite thus provides additional insights into the excess adiposity generated by a Western diet, and a compelling explanation for the promotion of tumour growth by high-fructose corn syrup.",
