    "text": "AN INTEGRATED VIEW OF THE METABOLIC AND GENETIC BASIS FOR OBESITY\n\nThe propensity to obesity in animals and man identifies those individuals who are genetically favoured to survive when food supplies are scarce. Obese subjects are limited in their ability to produce heat, either in a cold environment or after food, because of a reduced activity in skeletal muscle of a \"futile\" cycle in glucose metabolism. The impaired thermogenesis reduces the maintenance requirement for energy in the pre-obese individual so that a \"normal\" energy intake can only be balanced by excessive exercise or the expansion of adipocytes. The basal metabolic rate rises as obesity develops and compensates for the impaired thermogenic mechanism.",

    "text": "Genetic Obesity: Is the Defect in the Sympathetic Nervous System? A Review Through Developmental Studies in the Preobese Zucker Rat\n\nThe chronological analysis of anomalies that emerge within the first postnatal week in fa/fa rats strongly suggests that increased lipid storage leading to obesity in Zucker rats is a consequence of a defect in energy expenditure. In the search for an unifying hypothesis that might explain the etiology of this genetic obesity, an alteration in the nervous system appears the most likely to agree with the monogenic transmittance of the syndrome. Such an alteration could cause a general defect in the peripheral organs, which are sympathetically innervated, and explain the decreased thermogenesis in BAT of fa/fa rats and in other organs like skeletal muscles (via decreased futile cycles activity; 150). It may also explain the decrease in the peripheral utilization of triglycerides and glucose, principally by skeletal muscles and BAT, which results in excess circulating levels of these substrates that could then be shunted for storage in WAT. The hyperinsulinemia, which progressively develops in preobese rats from 10 days onward, could be explained either by an increased parasympathetic nervous system activity (8) or by a vagal sensitization of pancreatic insulin secretion to the increased levels of circulating glucose (105). This latter idea is consistent with a cause and effect dependency between a decreased sympathetic activity (possibly responsible for increasing plasma glucose levels) and the emergence of hyperinsulinemia. Hyperphagia, the date of emergence of which cannot be separated from that of hyperinsulinemia, could be a consequence of the latter (78), and/or a defect in the hypothalamic control of food intake (1 5 1). When hyperphagia and hyperinsulinemia develop, the anomalies in adipose tissue accretion get worse and a cascade development of new alterations develops in other organs (liver, muscles, brain, etc.). These alterations may give rise to a new dynamic metabolic and hormonal re-equilibration. As a result, anomalies present in older fa/fa rats may only be a consequence of earlier re-equilibrations and should be analyzed accordingly The etiology of the genetic obesity syndrome of Zucker rats appears to result from a disturbance in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, whose main and first expression is a decreased thermogenesis. The primary genetic defect(s) of fa/fa rats probably resides in discrete regions of the hypothalamus or at a higher level of regulation, i.e., in the central nervous system.",

    "text": "Increase in mitochondrial content of long-chain acyl-CoA in brown adipose tissue during cold-acclimation\n\nThe mitochondrial content of long-chain acyl-CoA esters in the brown adipose tissue of guinea pigs increased 3.5-fold from a level of 92 +/- 17 pmol per mg protein (+/- S.E.; n = 7) in the control animals adapted at 22 degrees C to a new steady-state level of 328 +/- 20 pmol per mg protein (+/- S.E.; n = 46) after 10 days of cold-acclimation (5 degrees C). These low values of long-chain acyl-CoA species and the slow adaptive response for their increase do not support the proposal (Cannon, B., Sindin, U. and Romert, L. (1977) FEBS Lett. 4, 43-46) that the fatty acid CoA-esters have a physiological function in the regulation of the H+ (or OH-) permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Experimental evidence is presented supporting the proposal that the long-chain acyl-CoA species are largely confined to the cytosolic side of the inner membrane. The activity of the adenine nucleotide translocase, as estimated at 25 degrees C in the reverse direction, was found to increase 5-fold upon depletion of the mitochondria of fatty acids (free and esterified) by preincubation with bovine serum albumin. The presence of potent inhibitors, i.e., long-chain acyl-CoA species, of adenine nucleotide translocation in brown adipose tissue of thermogenically active animals further supports the conclusion that ATP hydrolyzing mechanisms contribute insignificantly to long-term thermogenesis. The low values of long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.1) activity, as measured in intact mitochondria and on a mitochondrial matrix fraction (i.e., 1.6 nmol X min-1 per mg protein), do not support the proposal that the hydrolase activity plays a significant role in the loose-coupling of brown adipose tissue mitochondria, either by a futile cycle mechanism or promoted by free fatty acid-induced uncoupling.",

    "text": "Dehydroepiandrosterone and Body Fat\n\nDehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is the most abundant circulating adrenal steroid in man, yet its physiologic role and that of its parent compound DHEA are unknown. Age-related decreases in DHEA in association with increases in obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis are well known. Recent investigations in lower mammals (which do not secrete DHEA) have suggested that DHEA (or its metabolites) may function as an antiobesity agent in these models of obesity independent of food intake. Proposed mechanisms for the decrease in fat mass and lower weight gain when DHEA is given orally include increases in futile cycling and peroxisomal beta-oxidation and decreases in de novo lipogenesis. Alterations in the availability of reducing equivalents for lipid synthesis do not appear to explain this decrease. Changes in pancreatic insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity may also be responsible for some of these effects. Studies in humans have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of DHEA on body composition or energy expenditure at either pharmacologic or physiologic replacement doses for 1-3 months. Administration of DHEA to men or women has also not been shown to alter insulin sensitivity as measured by the minimal model or the euglycemic clamp technique. The effect of DHEA on peroxisomal beta-oxidation and de novo lipogenesis is not known. We conclude that a significant role for DHEA in the pharmacologic treatment of human obesity is unlikely.",

    "text": "Metabolic response to glucose overload in surgical stress: Energy disposal in brown adipose tissue\n\nThe metabolic response to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) overload was investigated in clinical studies of surgically stressed humans and in experimental studies of surgically stressed animals. In both studies, all non-protein calories were administered as glucose, and subjects were divided into two groups, classified according to the amount of caloric supplementation after surgical stress, i.e., either overfed or appropriate (groups C1 and C2, respectively, in the clinical study, and groups E1 and E2, respectively, in the experimental study). In the clinical study, the postoperative energy expenditure in group C1 increased from the preoperative value, becoming significantly more elevated than that in group C2. The respiratory quotient (RQ) in group C1 exceeded 1.0, representing lipogenesis from carbohydrate, and the plasma norepinephrine concentration was also higher in group C1, indicating that lipolysis was likely to have been enhanced in this milieu. These findings imply that lipogenesis and lipolysis can occur simultaneously, constituting a futile cycle, and that this activated cycle could be a reason for the increased energy expenditure associated with overfeeding after surgical stress. To gather further evidence, we evaluated the rate of lipogenesis and lipolytic activity in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT; BAT) in an experimental study of surgically stressed rats. In BAT, both lipogenesis and lipolysis were activated in group E1. The results of both studies suggest that glucose overload in surgically stressed individuals increases energy expenditure by activating a futile cycle and that BAT is more involved in this cycle than WAT.",

    "text": "To burn or to store.\n\nEnergy exists as organic molecules and heat in living organisms. In adult mammals, body weight and fat content remain unchanged if energy intake is strictly equivalent to energy expenditure. In other words, regulation of body weight requires energy of foods to be entirely dissipated as heat. Imbalance between ingested energy and thermogenesis induces obesity or thinness. Alterations of food intake or energy expenditure represent the two causes of body weight disturbance. It is accepted that individuals differ in food efficiency i.e. ability to metabolize foods and store fat or totally burn nutrients. Mechanisms of food efficiency and futile cycles are presented. I started my research work analysing thermogenic mechanism in brown adipose tissue. Actually, in addition to white adipose tissue which is the major type of adipose tissue, mammals own another type of adipose tissue referred to as brown adipose tissue. This later tissue is an activatable thermogenic organ which oxidizes fatty acids and releases heat in blood stream. Brown fat is activated during exposure to the cold (in rodents), at birth, and during arousal in hibernators. My initial work helped to characterize a mitochondrial protein named uncoupling protein or UCP which is responsible for activation of fatty acid oxidation and heat production in brown adipocytes. Actually, in most cells, fifty per cent of oxidation energy is recovered as ATP in mitochondria through the process of coupling of respiration to ADP phosphorylation. In contrast to mitochondria of most tissues, brown adipocyte mitochondria can escape the obligatorily coupling of respiration and waste almost ninety per cent of respiration energy as thermogenesis. UCP characterization and its molecular cloning as well as antibodies obtention were used to better understand cellular thermogenesis. Brown adipocytes were identified in babies and adult patients with pheochromocytoma. More recently, research on the brown fat UCP helped us to identify UCP2, a UCP homolog present in most human and animal tissues. A family of UCPs exist in animals and plants. These UCPs may function as mitochondrial uncouplers. However, the ancient function of the UCPs may be rather associated to adaptation to oxygen and control of free radicals than to thermogenesis. Further studies of UCPs will improve the knowledge of mitochondrial metabolism and substrate oxidation. In other respects, analysis of molecular mechanisms controlling respiration uncoupling may contribute to new strategies of treatment of metabolic disorders such as obesity.",

    "text": "Retrograde regulation due to mitochondrial dysfunction may be an important mechanism for carcinogenesis\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction has crucial importance in carcinogenesis. Due to several reasons, it may lead to insufficiency in the electron transport chain, which activates a series of cytosolic proteins. These proteins are transported to the nucleus and promote the activation of genes leading to intracellular diverse metabolic, regulatory, signalization and stress-related pathways. Retrograde regulation is the general term for mitochondrial signaling, and is broadly defined as cellular responses to alterations in functional state of mitochondria. This signaling pathway is triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction. The retrograde response is not a simple On-Off switch, but rather it responds in a continuous manner to the changing metabolic needs of the cell. Communication between mitochondria and the nucleus is important for a variety of cellular processes such as carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, cell cycle and proliferation, and cell growth and morphogenesis. As a result of retrograde regulation, the cell, actually a component of the multicellular organism, transforms to a unicellular lifestyle and initiates a developing course, independent of the systemic structure. This transformed cell runs metabolic regulations effectively in order to utilize all energy depots, mainly the adipose tissue of the multicellular organism. The most important one is the active utilization of glyoxylate cycle, through which the malign cells supply glucose from fats. Continuously acting glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and de novo lipogenesis constitute futile cycles. This in turn causes cachexia by maintaining the organism in constant negative energy balance. Mitochondria-to-nucleus stress signaling activates some of the genes implicated in tumor progression and tumor cell metastasis. Retrograde regulation also renders the cell more resistant to apoptosis. It is becoming clearer which genes control the retrograde response in human cells. Most probably, MYC is one of the transcription factors necessary for this response.",

    "text": "Recombinant human FIZZ3/resistin stimulates lipolysis in cultured human adipocytes, mouse adipose explants, and normal mice.\n\nHuman FIZZ3 (hFIZZ3) was identified as an ortholog of mouse resistin (mResistin), an adipocyte-specific secreted factor linked to insulin resistance in rodents. Unlike mResistin, hFIZZ3 is expressed in macrophages and monocytes, but is undetectable in adipose tissue. The profound macrophage infiltration of adipose that occurs during obesity suggests that hFIZZ3 may play an important role in adipocyte biology. Using a recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli, we report here that chronic treatment of cultured human adipocytes with hFIZZ3 results in hypotropic cells with smaller lipid droplets. Recombinant hFIZZ3 facilitates preadipocyte proliferation and stimulates adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis, whereas recombinant mResistin inhibits adipocyte differentiation, with no detectable effect on proliferation or lipolysis. In addition, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and Akt phosphorylation are not altered in hFIZZ3-treated adipocytes, indicating an intact insulin response. In mouse adipose explants, hFIZZ3 accelerates simultaneously triglyceride lipolysis and fatty acid reesterification, as assessed by measurement of glycerol and fatty acid release. Consistent with the in vitro findings, acute administration of recombinant hFIZZ3 into normal mice caused a significant increase in serum glycerol concentration with no elevation in free fatty acid at 45 min post injection. Taken together, the data suggest that recombinant hFIZZ3 can influence adipose metabolism by regulating preadipocyte cell number, adipocyte lipid content, and energy expenditure via accelerating the fatty acid/triglyceride futile cycle.",

    "text": "The CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant reverses the diet‐induced obesity phenotype through the regulation of lipolysis and energy balance\n\nWe investigated the molecular events involved in the long-lasting reduction of adipose mass by the selective CB1 antagonist, SR141716. Its effects were assessed at the transcriptional level both in white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues in a diet-induced obesity model in mice. Our data clearly indicated that SR141716 reversed the phenotype of obese adipocytes at both macroscopic and genomic levels. First, oral treatment with SR141716 at 10 mg/kg/d for 40 days induced a robust reduction of obesity, as shown by the 50% decrease in adipose mass together with a major restoration of white adipocyte morphology similar to lean animals. Second, we found that the major alterations in gene expression levels induced by obesity in WAT and BAT were mostly reversed in SR141716-treated obese mice. Importantly, the transcriptional patterns of treated obese mice were similar to those obtained in the CB1 receptor knockout mice fed a high-fat regimen and which are resistant to obesity, supporting a CB1 receptor-mediated process. Functional analysis of these modulations indicated that the reduction of adipose mass by the molecule resulted from an enhanced lipolysis through the induction of enzymes of the beta-oxidation and TCA cycle, increased energy expenditure, mainly through futile cycling (calcium and substrate), and a tight regulation of glucose homeostasis. These changes accompanied a significant cellular remodeling and contributed to a reduction of the obesity-related inflammatory status. In addition to a transient reduction of food consumption, increases of both fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure induced by the molecule summate leading to a sustained weight loss. Altogether, these data strongly indicate that the endocannabinoid system has a major role in the regulation of energy metabolism.",

    "text": "Disruption of BCATm in Mice Leads to Increased Energy Expenditure Associated with the Activation of a Futile Protein Turnover Cycle\n\nLeucine is recognized as a nutrient signal; however, the long-term in vivo consequences of leucine signaling and the role of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism in this signaling remain unclear. To investigate these questions, we disrupted the BCATm gene, which encodes the enzyme catalyzing the first step in peripheral BCAA metabolism. BCATm(-/-) mice exhibited elevated plasma BCAAs and decreased adiposity and body weight, despite eating more food, along with increased energy expenditure, remarkable improvements in glucose and insulin tolerance, and protection from diet-induced obesity. The increased energy expenditure did not seem to be due to altered locomotor activity, uncoupling proteins, sympathetic activity, or thyroid hormones but was strongly associated with food consumption and an active futile cycle of increased protein degradation and synthesis. These observations suggest that elevated BCAAs and/or loss of BCAA catabolism in peripheral tissues play an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure.",

    "text": "Methionine restriction effects on 11β-HSD1 activity and lipogenic/lipolytic balance in F344 rat adipose tissue\n\nMethionine restriction (MR) limits age-related adiposity in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. To assess the mechanism of adiposity resistance, the effect of MR on adipose tissue (AT) 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11beta-HSD1) was examined. MR induced 11beta-HSD1 activity in all ATs, correlating with increased tissue corticosterone. However, an inverse relationship between 11beta-HSD1 activity and adipocyte size was observed. Because dietary restriction controls lipogenic and lipolytic rates, MR's effects on lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes were evaluated. MR increased adipose triglyceride lipase and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) protein levels but induced ACC phosphorylation at serine residues that render the enzyme inactive, suggesting alterations of basal lipolysis and lipogenesis. In contrast, no changes in basal or phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase levels were observed. ACC-phosphorylated sites were specific for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); therefore, AMPK activation was evaluated. Significant differences in AMPKalpha protein, phosphorylation, and activity levels were observed only in retroperitoneal fat from MR rats. No differences in protein kinase A phosphorylation and intracellular cAMP levels were detected. In vitro studies revealed increased lipid degradation and a trend toward increased lipid synthesis, suggesting the presence of a futile cycle. In conclusion, MR disrupts the lipogenic/lipolytic balance, contributing importantly to adiposity resistance in F344 rats.",

    "text": "Modulator recognition factor-2 regulates triglyceride metabolism in adipocytes\n\nMice lacking modulator recognition factor-2 (Mrf-2; ARID5B) have less fat in brown and white adipose tissues, partly because of a defect in adipocyte differentiation. We have also shown that knockdown of Mrf-2 decreases the expression of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma, and inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Since these transcription factors may also contribute to the maintenance of adipocyte function, we examined the effects of siRNA targeted to Mrf-2 on triglyceride metabolism in mature 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes. As it did in differentiating adipocytes, knockdown of Mrf-2 decreased the expression of both C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma. Knockdown of Mrf-2 also activated both lipolysis and triglyceride synthesis, and caused a significant increase in the ratio of glycerol release to free fatty acid release. This suggests that knockdown of Mrf-2 increases the rate of fatty acid recycling in 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes. Continual cycling of fatty acids through lipolysis and triglyceride synthesis could lead to dissipation of energy. Therefore, the activation of such a futile cycle via the suppression of Mrf-2 could be an effective treatment for obesity and diabetes.",

    "text": "The activation of hepatic and muscle polyamine catabolism improves glucose homeostasis\n\nThe mitochondrial biogenesis and energy expenditure regulator, PGC-1α, has been previously reported to be induced in the white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver of mice overexpressing spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). The activation of PGC-1α in these mouse lines leads to increased number of mitochondria, improved glucose homeostasis, reduced WAT mass and elevated basal metabolic rate. The constant activation of polyamine catabolism produces a futile cycle that greatly reduces the ATP pools and induces 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn activates PGC-1α in WAT. In this study, we have investigated the effects of activated polyamine catabolism on the glucose and energy metabolisms when targeted to specific tissues. For that we used a mouse line overexpressing SSAT under the endogenous SSAT promoter, an inducible SSAT overexpressing mouse model using the metallothionein I promoter (MT-SSAT), and a mouse model with WAT-specific SSAT overexpression (aP2-SSAT). The results demonstrated that WAT-specific SSAT overexpression was sufficient to increase the number of mitochondria, reduce WAT mass and protect the mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity. However, the improvement in the glucose homeostasis is achieved only when polyamine catabolism is enhanced at the same time in the liver and skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that the tissue-specific targeting of activated polyamine catabolism may reveal new possibilities for the development of drugs boosting mitochondrial metabolism and eventually for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

    "text": "Large increases in adipose triacylglycerol flux in Cushingoid CRH-Tg mice are explained by futile cycling\n\nGlucocorticoids are extremely effective anti-inflammatory therapies, but their clinical use is limited due to severe side effects, including osteoporosis, muscle wasting, fat redistribution, and skin thinning. Here we use heavy water labeling and mass spectrometry to measure fluxes through metabolic pathways impacted by glucocorticoids. We combine these methods with measurements of body composition in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-transgenic (Tg)(+) mice that have chronically elevated, endogenously produced corticosterone and a phenotype that closely mimics Cushing's disease in humans. CRH-Tg(+) mice had increased adipose mass, adipose triglyceride synthesis, and greatly increased triglyceride/fatty acid cycling in subcutaneous and abdominal fat depots and increased de novo lipogenesis in the abdominal depot. In bone, CRH-Tg(+) mice had decreased bone mass, absolute collagen synthesis rates, and collagen breakdown rate. In skin, CRH-Tg(+) mice had decreased skin thickness and absolute collagen synthesis rates but no decrease in the collagen breakdown rate. In muscle, CRH-Tg(+) mice had decreased muscle mass and absolute protein synthesis but no decrease in the protein breakdown rate. We conclude that chronic exposure to endogenous glucocorticoid excess in mice is associated with ongoing decreases in bone collagen, skin collagen, and muscle protein synthesis without compensatory reduction (coupling) of breakdown rates in skin and muscle. Both of these actions contribute to reduced protein pool sizes. We also conclude that increased cycling between triglycerides and free fatty acids occurs in both abdominal and subcutaneous fat depots in CRH-Tg(+) mice. CRH-Tg mice have both increased lipolysis and increased triglyceride synthesis in adipose tissue.",

    "text": "Dynamic changes in lipid droplet-associated proteins in the “browning” of white adipose tissues\n\nThe morphological and functional differences between lipid droplets (LDs) in brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues will largely be determined by their associated proteins. Analysing mRNA expression in mice fat depots we have found that most LD protein genes are expressed at higher levels in BAT, with the greatest differences observed for Cidea and Plin5. Prolonged cold exposure, which induces the appearance of brown-like adipocytes in mice WAT depots, was accompanied with the potentiation of the lipolytic machinery, with changes in ATGL, CGI-58 and G0S2 gene expression. However the major change detected in WAT was the enhancement of Cidea mRNA. Together with the increase in Cidec, it indicates that LD enlargement through LD-LD transference of fat is an important process during WAT browning. To study the dynamics of this phenotypic change, we have applied 4D confocal microscopy in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells under sustained β-adrenergic stimulation. Under these conditions the cells experienced a LD remodelling cycle, with progressive reduction on the LD size by lipolysis, followed by the formation of new LDs, which were subjected to an enlargement process, likely to be CIDE-triggered, until the cell returned to the basal state. This transformation would be triggered by the activation of a thermogenic futile cycle of lipolysis/lipogenesis and could facilitate the molecular mechanism for the unilocular to multilocular transformation during WAT browning.

    "text": "Divergent effects of oxytocin treatment of obese diabetic mice on adiposity and diabetes.\n\nOxytocin has been suggested as a novel therapeutic against obesity, because it induces weight loss and improves glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese rodents. A recent clinical pilot study confirmed the oxytocin-induced weight-reducing effect in obese nondiabetic subjects. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved and the impact on the main comorbidity associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, are unknown. Lean and ob/ob mice (model of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and diabetes) were treated for 2 weeks with different doses of oxytocin, analogues with longer half-life (carbetocin) or higher oxytocin receptor specificity ([Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin). Food and water intake, body weight, and glycemia were measured daily. Glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance, body composition, several hormones, metabolites, gene expression, as well as enzyme activities were determined. Although no effect of oxytocin on the main parameters was observed in lean mice, the treatment dose-dependently reduced food intake and body weight gain in ob/ob animals. Carbetocin behaved similarly to oxytocin, whereas [Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin (TGOT) and a low oxytocin dose decreased body weight gain without affecting food intake. The body weight gain-reducing effect was limited to the fat mass only, with decreased lipid uptake, lipogenesis, and inflammation, combined with increased futile cycling in abdominal adipose tissue. Surprisingly, oxytocin treatment of ob/ob mice was accompanied by a worsening of basal glycemia and glucose tolerance, likely due to increased corticosterone levels and stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. These results impose careful selection of the conditions in which oxytocin treatment should be beneficial for obesity and its comorbidities, and their relevance for human pathology needs to be determined.",

    "text": "The role of skeletal‐muscle‐based thermogenic mechanisms in vertebrate endothermy\n\nThermogenesis is one of the most important homeostatic mechanisms that evolved during vertebrate evolution. Despite its importance for the survival of the organism, the mechanistic details behind various thermogenic processes remain incompletely understood. Although heat production from muscle has long been recognized as a thermogenic mechanism, whether muscle can produce heat independently of contraction remains controversial. Studies in birds and mammals suggest that skeletal muscle can be an important site of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) and can be recruited during cold adaptation, although unequivocal evidence is lacking. Much research on thermogenesis during the last two decades has been focused on brown adipose tissue (BAT). These studies clearly implicate BAT as an important site of NST in mammals, in particular in newborns and rodents. However, BAT is either absent, as in birds and pigs, or is only a minor component, as in adult large mammals including humans, bringing into question the BAT-centric view of thermogenesis. This review focuses on the evolution and emergence of various thermogenic mechanisms in vertebrates from fish to man. A careful analysis of the existing data reveals that muscle was the earliest facultative thermogenic organ to emerge in vertebrates, long before the appearance of BAT in eutherian mammals. Additionally, these studies suggest that muscle-based thermogenesis is the dominant mechanism of heat production in many species including birds, marsupials, and certain mammals where BAT-mediated thermogenesis is absent or limited. We discuss the relevance of our recent findings showing that uncoupling of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) by sarcolipin (SLN), resulting in futile cycling and increased heat production, could be the basis for NST in skeletal muscle. The overall goal of this review is to highlight the role of skeletal muscle as a thermogenic organ and provide a balanced view of thermogenesis in vertebrates.",

    "text": "Sarcolipin Is a Key Determinant of the Basal Metabolic Rate, and Its Overexpression Enhances Energy Expenditure and Resistance against Diet-induced Obesity*\n\nSarcolipin (SLN) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) in muscle. SLN binding to SERCA uncouples Ca(2+) transport from ATP hydrolysis. By this mechanism, SLN promotes the futile cycling of SERCA, contributing to muscle heat production. We recently showed that SLN plays an important role in cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. However, the detailed mechanism of how SLN regulates muscle metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we used both SLN knockout (Sln(-/-)) and skeletal muscle-specific SLN overexpression (Sln(OE)) mice to explore energy metabolism by pair feeding (fixed calories) and high-fat diet feeding (ad libitum). Our results show that, upon pair feeding, Sln(OE) mice lost weight compared with the WT, but Sln(-/-) mice gained weight. Interestingly, when fed with a high-fat diet, Sln(OE) mice consumed more calories but gained less weight and maintained a normal metabolic profile in comparison with WT and Sln(-/-) mice. We found that oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation were increased markedly in Sln(OE) mice. There was also an increase in both mitochondrial number and size in Sln(OE) muscle, together with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and PPAR γ coactivator 1 α (PGC1α), key transcriptional activators of mitochondrial biogenesis and enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism. These results, taken together, establish an important role for SLN in muscle metabolism and energy expenditure. On the basis of these data we propose that SLN is a novel target for enhancing whole-body energy expenditure.",

    "text": "A Creatine-Driven Substrate Cycle Enhances Energy Expenditure and Thermogenesis in Beige Fat\n\nThermogenic brown and beige adipose tissues dissipate chemical energy as heat, and their thermogenic activities can combat obesity and diabetes. Herein the functional adaptations to cold of brown and beige adipose depots are examined using quantitative mitochondrial proteomics. We identify arginine/creatine metabolism as a beige adipose signature and demonstrate that creatine enhances respiration in beige-fat mitochondria when ADP is limiting. In murine beige fat, cold exposure stimulates mitochondrial creatine kinase activity and induces coordinated expression of genes associated with creatine metabolism. Pharmacological reduction of creatine levels decreases whole-body energy expenditure after administration of a β3-agonist and reduces beige and brown adipose metabolic rate. Genes of creatine metabolism are compensatorily induced when UCP1-dependent thermogenesis is ablated, and creatine reduction in Ucp1-deficient mice reduces core body temperature. These findings link a futile cycle of creatine metabolism to adipose tissue energy expenditure and thermal homeostasis. PAPERCLIP.",

    "text": "Feeding the critically ill obese patient: a systematic review protocol\n\nREVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify effective enteral nutritional regimens targeting protein and calorie delivery for the critically ill obese patient on morbidity and mortality.More specifically, the review question is:In the critically ill obese patient, what is the optimal enteral protein and calorie target that improves mortality and morbidity?\nBACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health, or, empirically, as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m. Twenty-eight percent of the Australian population is obese with the prevalence rising to 44% in rural areas, and there is evidence that rates of obesity are increasing. The prevalence of obese patients in intensive care largely mirrors that of the general population. There is concern, however, that this may also be rising. A recently published multi-center nutritional study of critically ill patients reported a mean BMI of 29 in their sample, suggesting that just under 50% of their intensive care population is obese. It is inevitable, therefore, that the intensivist will care for the critically ill obese patient.Managing the critically ill obese patient is challenging, not least due to the co-morbid diseases frequently associated with obesity, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia, sleep disordered breathing and respiratory insufficiency, hepatic steatohepatitis, chronic kidney disease and hypertension. There is also evidence that metabolic processes differ in the obese patient, particularly those with underlying insulin resistance, itself a marker of the metabolic syndrome, which may predispose to futile cycling, altered fuel utilization and protein catabolism. These issues are compounded by altered drug pharmacokinetics, and the additional logistical issues associated with prophylactic, therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.It is entirely plausible that the altered metabolic processes observed in the obese intensify and compound the metabolic changes that occur during critical illness. The early phases of critical illness are characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, resulting in a catabolic state driven by the stress response. Activation of the stress response involves up-regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of pituitary hormones resulting in altered cortisol metabolism and elevated levels of endogenous catecholamines. These produce a range of metabolic disturbances including stress hyperglycemia, arising from both peripheral resistance to the effects of anabolic factors (predominantly insulin) and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Proteolysis is accelerated, releasing amino acids that are thought to be important in supporting tissue repair, immune defense and the synthesis of acute phase reactants. There is also altered mobilization of fuel stores, futile cycling, and evidence of altered lipoprotein metabolism. In the short term this is likely to be an adaptive response, but with time and ongoing inflammation this becomes maladaptive with a concomitant risk of protein-calorie malnutrition, immunosuppression and wasting of functional muscle tissue resulting from protein catabolism, and this is further compounded by disuse atrophy. Muscle atrophy and intensive care unit (ICU) acquired weakness is complex and poorly understood, but it is postulated that the provision of calories and sufficient protein to avoid a negative nitrogen balance mitigates this process. Avoiding lean muscle mass loss in the obese intuitively has substantial implications, given the larger mass that is required to be mobilized during their rehabilitation phase.There is, in addition, evolving evidence that hormones derived from both the gut and adipose tissue are also involved in the response to stress and critical illness, and that adipose tissue in particular is not a benign tissue bed, but rather should be considered an endocrine organ. Some of these hormones are thought to be pro-inflammatory and some anti-inflammatory; however both the net result and clinical significance of these are yet to be fully elucidated.The provision of adequate nutrition has become an integral component of supportive ICU care, but is complex. There is ongoing debate within critical care literature regarding the optimal route of delivery, the target dose, and the macronutrient components (proportion of protein and non-protein calories) of nutritional support. A number of studies have associated caloric deficit with morbidity and mortality, with the resultant assumption that prescribing sufficient calories to match energy expenditure will reduce morbidity and mortality, although the evidence base underpinning this assumption is limited to observational studies and small, randomized trials.There is research available that suggests hyper-caloric feeding or hyper-alimentation, particularly of carbohydrates, may result in increased morbidity including hyperglycemia, liver steatosis, respiratory insufficiency with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, re-feeding syndrome and immune suppression. But the results from studies of hypo-caloric and eucaloric feeding regimens in critically ill patients are conflicting, independent of the added metabolic complexities observed in the critically ill obese patient.Notwithstanding the debate regarding the dose and components of nutritional therapy, there is consensus that nutrition should be provided, preferably via the enteral route, and preferably initiated early in the ICU admission. The enteral route is preferred for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is cost. In addition there is evidence to suggest the enteral route is associated with the maintenance of gut integrity, a reduction in bacterial translocation and infection rates, a reduction in the incidence of stress ulceration, attenuation of oxidative stress, release of incretins and other entero-hormones, and modulation of systemic immune responses. Yet there is evidence that the initiation of enteral nutritional support for the obese critically ill patient is delayed, and that when delivered is at sub-optimal levels. The reasons for this remain obscure, but may be associated with the false assumption that every obese patient has nutritional reserves due to their adipose tissues, and can therefore withstand longer periods with no, or reduced nutritional support. In fact obesity does not necessarily protect from malnutrition, particularly protein and micronutrient malnutrition. It has been suggested by some authors that the malnutrition status of critically ill patients is a stronger predictor of mortality than BMI, and that once malnutrition status is controlled for, the apparent protective effects of obesity observed in several epidemiological studies dissipate. This would be consistent with the large body of evidence that associates malnutrition (BMI < 20 kg/m) with increased mortality, and has led some authors to postulate that the weight-mortality relationship is U-shaped. This has proven difficult to demonstrate, however, due to recognized confounding influences such as chronic co-morbidities, baseline nutritional status and the nature of the presenting critical illness.This has led to interest in nutritional regimens targeting alternative calorie and protein goals to protect the obese critically ill patient from complications arising from critical illness, and particularly protein catabolism. However, of the three major nutritional organizations, the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) is the only professional organization to make specific recommendations about providing enteral nutritional support to the critically ill obese patient, recommending a regimen targeting a hypo-caloric, high-protein goal. It is thought that this regimen, in which 60-70% of caloric requirements are provided promotes steady weight loss, while providing sufficient protein to achieve a neutral, or slightly positive, nitrogen balance, mitigating lean muscle mass loss, and allowing for wound healing. Targeting weight loss is proposed to improve insulin sensitivity, improve nursing care and reduce the risk of co-morbidities, although how this occurs and whether it can occur over the relatively short time frame of an intensive care admission (days to weeks) remains unclear. Despite these recommendations observational data of international nutritional practice suggest that ICU patients are fed uniformly low levels of calories and protein across BMI groups.Supporting the critically ill obese patient will become an increasingly important skill in the intensivist's armamentarium, and enteral nutritional therapy forms a cornerstone of this support. Yet, neither the optimal total caloric goal nor the macronutrient components of a feeding regimen for the critically ill obese patient is evident. Although the suggestion that altering the macronutrient goals for this vulnerable group of patients appears to have a sound physiological basis, the level of evidence supporting this remains unclear, and there are no systematic reviews on this topic. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate existing literature to determine the best available evidence describing a nutritional strategy that targets energy and protein delivery to reduce morbidity and mortality for the obese patient who is critically ill.",

    "text": "miR-378 Activates the Pyruvate-PEP Futile Cycle and Enhances Lipolysis to Ameliorate Obesity in Mice\n\nObesity has been linked to many health problems, such as diabetes. However, there is no drug that effectively treats obesity. Here, we reveal that miR-378 transgenic mice display reduced fat mass, enhanced lipolysis, and increased energy expenditure. Notably, administering AgomiR-378 prevents and ameliorates obesity in mice. We also found that the energy deficiency seen in miR-378 transgenic mice was due to impaired glucose metabolism. This impairment was caused by an activated pyruvate-PEP futile cycle via the miR-378-Akt1-FoxO1-PEPCK pathway in skeletal muscle and enhanced lipolysis in adipose tissues mediated by miR-378-SCD1. Our findings demonstrate that activating the pyruvate-PEP futile cycle in skeletal muscle is the primary cause of elevated lipolysis in adipose tissues of miR-378 transgenic mice, and it helps orchestrate the crosstalk between muscle and fat to control energy homeostasis in mice. Thus, miR-378 may serve as a promising agent for preventing and treating obesity in humans.",

    "text": "The bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid directly modulates metabolic pathways in white adipose tissue in vitro: insight into how bile acids decrease obesity\n\nObesity is a worldwide epidemic, and associated pathologies, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular alterations, are increasingly escalating morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.",

    "text": "Effects of Stanniocalcin-1 on glucose flux in rat brown adipose tissue\n\nThe present work assesses in�vitro the role of human Stanniocalcin 1 (hSTC-1) in 14C-glucose metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) from fed rat. In the fed state, hSTC-1 decreases the incorporation of 14C from glucose into lipids in the rat BAT. The data support the hypothesis that the capacity of the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)-generating pathway (glycolysis) from glucose is regulated by hSTC-1, decreasing the adequate supply of G3P needed for fatty acid esterification and triacylglycerol (TG) storage in BAT. The results also suggest the effect of hSTC-1 on de novo fatty acid synthesis from pyruvate generated by 14C-glucose in the glycolysis pathway. In addition, by decreasing lipogenesis, hSTC-1 increased ATP levels and these two factors may decrease BAT thermogenic function. The presence of hSTC-1 in the incubation medium did not alter 14C-glucose and 14C-1-palmitic acid oxidation. The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) expression was not altered by hSTC-1 either. In conclusion, hSTC-1 is one of the hormonal factors that control glucose metabolism in BAT in the fed state. The decrease of TG capacity synthesis from 14C-glucose by hSTC-1 compromises the BAT thermogenic capacity. Furthermore, the increase in ATP levels would inhibit a futile cycle via UCP-1, which dissipates oxidative energy as heat.",

    "text": "White and beige adipocytes: are they metabolically distinct?\n\nThe white adipose tissue (WAT) exhibits great plasticity and can undergo \"browning\" and acquire features of the brown adipose tissue (BAT), which takes place following cold exposure, chronic endurance exercise or β3-adrenergic stimulation. WAT that underwent browning is characterized by the presence of \"beige\" adipocytes, which are morphologically similar to brown adipocytes, express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are considered thermogenically competent. Thus, inducing a BAT-like phenotype in the WAT could promote energy dissipation within this depot, reducing the availability of substrate that would otherwise be stored in the WAT. Importantly, BAT in humans only represents a small proportion of total body mass, which limits the thermogenic capacity of this tissue. Therefore, browning of the WAT could significantly expand the energy-dissipating capacity of the organism and be of therapeutic value in the treatment of metabolic diseases. However, the question remains as to whether WAT indeed changes its metabolic profile from an essentially fat storage/release compartment to an energy dissipating compartment that functions much like BAT. Here, we discuss the differences with respect to thermogenic capacity and metabolic characteristics between white and beige adipocytes to determine whether the latter cells indeed significantly enhance their capacity to dissipate energy through UCP1-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling or by the activation of alternative UCP1-independent futile cycles.",

    "text": "Barriers to cancer nutrition therapy: excess catabolism of muscle and adipose tissues induced by tumour products and chemotherapy\n\nCancer-associated malnutrition is driven by reduced dietary intake and by underlying metabolic changes (such as inflammation, anabolic resistance, proteolysis, lipolysis and futile cycling) induced by the tumour and activated immune cells. Cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapies also elicit proteolysis and lipolysis at the tissue level. In this review, we summarise specific mediators and chemotherapy effects that provoke excess proteolysis in muscle and excess lipolysis in adipose tissue. A nutritionally relevant question is whether and to what degree these catabolic changes can be reversed by nutritional therapy. In skeletal muscle, tumour factors and chemotherapy drugs activate intracellular signals that result in the suppression of protein synthesis and activation of a transcriptional programme leading to autophagy and degradation of myofibrillar proteins. Cancer nutrition therapy is intended to ensure adequate provision of energy fuels and a complete repertoire of biosynthetic building blocks. There is some promising evidence that cancer- and chemotherapy-associated metabolic alterations may also be corrected by certain individual nutrients. The amino acids leucine and arginine provided in the diet at least partially reverse anabolic suppression in muscle, while n-3 PUFA inhibit the transcriptional activation of muscle catabolism. Optimal conditions for exploiting these anabolic and anti-catabolic effects are currently under study, with the overall aim of net improvements in muscle mass, functionality, performance status and treatment tolerance.",

    "text": "Dietary n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids upregulate energy dissipating metabolic pathways conveying anti-obesogenic effects in mice\n\nBackgroundWe previously reported on the anti-obesogenic and anti-inflammatory effects associated with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in our diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Two isocaloric high-fat diets (HFDs; 48 kJ% fat), HFD (HF) and n-3 LCPUFA-enriched HFD (HF/n-3), and a control diet (C; 13 kJ% fat) were used. The underlying mechanisms however have largely remained unclear. Here, we assessed whether the reduced fat mass reflected n-3 LCPUFA-induced expression changes in lipid metabolism of the intestine, liver, and interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), as well as increased iBAT thermogenic capacity.MethodsFor HF/n-3, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were partially substituted by n-3 LCPUFA eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to achieve a balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio (0.84) compared to the unbalanced ratios of HF (13.5) and C (9.85). Intestine, liver and iBAT from male C57BL/6 J mice, fed defined soybean/palm oil-based diets for 12 weeks, were further analysed. Gene and protein expression analyses, immunohistochemistry and correlation analyses for metabolic interactions were performed.ResultsCompared to HF and C, our analyses suggest significantly diminished de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and/or increased hepatic and intestinal fatty acid oxidation (ω-oxidation and peroxisomal β-oxidation) in HF/n-3 mice. For iBAT, the thermogenic potential was enhanced upon HF/n-3 consistent with upregulated expression for uncoupling protein-1 and genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, a higher capacity for the supply and oxidation of fatty acids was observed and expression and correlation analyses indicated a coordinated regulation of energy metabolism and futile cycling of triacylglycerol (TAG). Moreover, HF/n-3 significantly increased the number of anti-inflammatory macrophages and eosinophils and significantly enhanced the levels of activated AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).ConclusionsOur data suggest that by targeting transcriptional regulatory pathways, AMPKα, and FGF21 as potential mediators, HF/n-3 activated less efficient pathways for energy production, such as peroxisomal β-oxidation, increased ATP consumption upon the induction of futile cycling of TAG, and additionally increased the thermogenic and oxidative potential of iBAT. Therefore, we consider n-3 LCPUFA as the potent inducer for upregulating energy dissipating metabolic pathways conveying anti-obesogenic effects in mice.",

    "text": "Switching on the furnace: Regulation of heat production in brown adipose tissue\n\nEndothermy requires a source of endogenous heat production. In birds, this is derived primarily from shivering, but in mammals it is mostly non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized tissue found in Eutherian mammals that is the source of most NST. Heat production in BAT depends primarily on the activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which decouples transport of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane from synthesis of ATP. UCP1 and hence heat production of BAT is regulated by many factors. In this paper we discuss the main factors activating UCP1 and increasing heat production. Probably the most well-known activator is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE) which is released from sympathetic nerve endings and binds to adrenergic receptors that are abundantly expressed on BAT. NE stimulates release of free-fatty acids. It was previously thought that such FFAs were essential for activation of UCP1. However recent work has suggested intracellular lipolysis is not essential and FFAs can be derived from extracellular sources. Thyroid hormones also exert impacts on metabolic rate via effects on brown adipocytes which express type 2 deiodinase. Knocking out DIO2 makes mice cold intolerant. Parathyroid hormone appears to also be a potent regulator of BAT activity and may be an important mediator of elevated expenditure during cancer cachexia, although this is disputed by observations that cachexia wasting is not blunted in UCP1 KO mice. Cardiac natriuretic peptides have also been implicated in regulating BAT thermogenesis and the interconversion of beige adipocytes from their white to brown form. Activation of BAT thermogenesis may be an important component of the post-ingestion rise in heat production. Recent work suggests the gut derived hormone secretin may play a key role in this effect, directly linking BAT activation to the alimentary tract. Not only gut hormones but also metabolites derived from gut microbiota such as butyrate may be an important activator of BAT during cold exposure. Additional regulatory factors include bone morphogenic proteins, fibroblast growth factor 21, Vascular endothelial growth factors and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptors which are important components of thermal sensing and hence how brown adipose tissue responds to the cold. In the future the main challenge is to understand how these regulatory factors combine with each other and with inhibitory factors to control heat production from BAT, and what their relative importance is in differing circumstances. Knocking out UCP1 has revealed other sources of heat production in BAT including creatine-dependent cycles and a futile cycle of Ca2+ shuttling into and out of the endoplasmic reticulum via the SERCA and ryanodine receptors.",

    "text": "[Basic Science of Cancer Cachexia].\n\nCachexia is considered as a complex metabolic disease accompanied by systemic inflammation. However, we still do not understand the essential nature of the metabolic disorder associated with cachexia or the precise molecular mechanisms that drive cachexia. This reviewsummarizes the current knowledge on the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia obtained mainly from mouse models with emphasis on the findings that could reach the bedside in the future. Basic studies using animal models of cancer cachexia indicate that mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and members of TGF-b superfamily disturb the cross-talks among metabolism-related organs including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, and CNS and thereby induce the collapse of metabolic homeostasis. The inhibitors of these mediators are currently under development for the treatment of cancer cachexia. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a key feature of cancer cachexia and is induced by enhanced proteolysis via ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system, as well as by decreased protein synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Adipose tissue atrophy due to excessive lipolysis is another common feature of cancer cachexia, and the involvement of the browning of white adipose tissue and of the increased energy expenditure associated with the futile cycle of lipolysis/lipogenesis is suggested. The liver of cachectic tumor-bearing mice shows increased gluconeogenesis which leads to energy expenditure via futile cycle, and also develops steatosis due to decreased triglyceride usage. In the CNS, inflammation in the hypothalamus induces anorexia and excessive peripheral energy expenditure. Cachectic animals also showresistance to the appetite-promoting effects of ghrelin. We hope that cancer cachexia will gain better awareness in the near future, leading to the growth and progress of the research field, and that the elucidation of its pathogenesis will contribute to the development of novel preventive/therapeutics strategies.",

    "text": "The capacity for oestrogen to influence obesity through brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in animal models: A systematic review and meta‐analysis\n\nPharmacological interventions to aid weight loss have historically targeted either appetite suppression or increased metabolic rate. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) possesses the capacity to expend energy in a futile cycle, thus increasing basal metabolic rate. In animal models, oestrogen has been implicated in the regulation of body weight, and it is hypothesized that oestrogen is acting by modulating BAT metabolism. A systematic search was performed, to identify research articles implementing in vivo oestrogen-related interventions and reporting outcome measures that provide direct or indirect measures of BAT metabolism. Meta-analyses were conducted where sufficient data were available. The final library of 67 articles were predominantly in rodent models and provided mostly indirect measures of BAT metabolism. Results of this review found that oestrogen's effects on body weight, in rats and possibly mice, are likely facilitated by both metabolic and appetitive mechanisms but are largely only found in ovariectomized models. There is a need for further studies to clarify the potential effects of oestrogen on BAT metabolism in gonad-intact and castrated male animal models.",

    "text": "Opportunities and challenges in the therapeutic activation of human energy expenditure and thermogenesis to manage obesity\n\nThe current obesity pandemic results from a physiological imbalance in which energy intake chronically exceeds energy expenditure (EE), and prevention and treatment strategies remain generally ineffective. Approaches designed to increase EE have been informed by decades of experiments in rodent models designed to stimulate adaptive thermogenesis, a long-term increase in metabolism, primarily induced by chronic cold exposure. At the cellular level, thermogenesis is achieved through increased rates of futile cycling, which are observed in several systems, most notably the regulated uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP generation by uncoupling protein 1, a tissue-specific protein present in mitochondria of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Physiological activation of BAT and other organ thermogenesis occurs through β-adrenergic receptors (AR), and considerable effort over the past 5 decades has been directed toward developing AR agonists capable of safely achieving a net negative energy balance while avoiding unwanted cardiovascular side effects. Recent discoveries of other BAT futile cycles based on creatine and succinate have provided additional targets. Complicating the current and developing pharmacological-, cold-, and exercise-based methods to increase EE is the emerging evidence for strong physiological drives toward restoring lost weight over the long term. Future studies will need to address technical challenges such as how to accurately measure individual tissue thermogenesis in humans; how to safely activate BAT and other organ thermogenesis; and how to sustain a negative energy balance over many years of treatment.",

The diet was supplemented or not by the tested compound alone or with the two TZDs combined individually with Omega-3. Activity of TAG/FA cycle in WAT was suppressed by the obesogenic HF diet. Additive effects in partial rescue of TAG/FA cycling in WAT were observed with both combined interventions, with a stronger effect of Omega-3 and MSDC-0602K.

    "text": "Thermal Stress Induces Long-Term Remodeling of Adipose Tissue and Is Associated with Systemic Dysfunction\n\nABSTRACT: Severe burns are characterized by the magnitude and duration of the hypermetabolic response thereafter, and demarcated by the loss of lean body mass and catabolism of fat stores. The aim of the present study was to delineate the temporal and location-specific physiological changes to adipose depots and downstream consequences post-burn in a murine model of thermal injury. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 30% total body surface area burn and body mass, food intake, and tissue mass were monitored for various time points up until 60 days postinjury. Mitochondrial respirometry was performed using a Seahorse XF96 analyzer. Lipolytic markers and browning markers were analyzed via Western blotting and histology. A severe burn results in a futile cycle of lipolysis and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, the sequelae of which include fat catabolism, hepatomegaly, and loss of body mass despite increased food intake. A dynamic remodeling of epididymal WAT was observed with acute and chronic increases in lipolysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that pathological browning of inguinal WAT persists up to 60 days post-burn, highlighting the magnitude of the β-adrenergic response to thermal injury. Our data suggests that adipose depots have a heterogeneous response to burns and that therapeutic interventions targeting these physiological changes can improve outcomes. These data may also have implications for treating catabolic conditions such as cancer cachexia as well as developing treatments for obesity and type II diabetes.",

    "text": "Recruitment and remodeling of peridroplet mitochondria in human adipose tissue\n\nBeige adipocyte mitochondria contribute to thermogenesis by uncoupling and by ATP-consuming futile cycles. Since uncoupling may inhibit ATP synthesis, it is expected that expenditure through ATP synthesis is segregated to a disparate population of mitochondria. Recent studies in mouse brown adipocytes identified peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) as having greater ATP synthesis and pyruvate oxidation capacities, while cytoplasmic mitochondria have increased fatty acid oxidation and uncoupling capacities. However, the occurrence of PDM in humans and the processes that result in their expansion have not been elucidated. Here, we describe a novel high-throughput assay to quantify PDM that is successfully applied to white adipose tissue from mice and humans. Using this approach, we found that PDM content varies between white and brown fat in both species. We used adipose tissue from pheochromocytoma (Pheo) patients as a model of white adipose tissue browning, which is characterized by an increase in the capacity for energy expenditure. In contrast with control subjects, PDM content was robustly increased in the periadrenal fat of Pheo patients. Remarkably, bioenergetic changes associated with browning were primarily localized to PDM compared to cytoplasmic mitochondria (CM). PDM isolated from periadrenal fat of Pheo patients had increased ATP-linked respiration, Complex IV content and activity, and maximal respiratory capacity. We found similar changes in a mouse model of re-browning where PDM content in whitened brown adipose tissue was increased upon re-browning induced by decreased housing temperature. Taken together, this study demonstrates the existence of PDM as a separate functional entity in humans and that browning in both mice and humans is associated with a robust expansion of peri-droplet mitochondria characterized by increased ATP synthesis linked respiration.",
