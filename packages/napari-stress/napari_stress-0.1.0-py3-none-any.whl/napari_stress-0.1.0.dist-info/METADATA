# napari-stress

This plugin provides tools for the analysis of surfaces in Napari, such as utilities to determine and refine the surface-representation of objects using a ray-casting approach and calculate the curvature of surfaces. 
It re-implements code in Napari that was written for [Gross et al. (2021): STRESS, an automated geometrical characterization of deformable particles for in vivo measurements of cell and tissue mechanical stresses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.437148v1) 
and has been made open source in [this repository](https://github.com/campaslab/STRESS).

## Usage

For documentation on how to use napari-stress both interactively from the napari-viewer or from code, please visit the [**documentation**](https://biapol.github.io/napari-stress/intro.html)


## Installation

Create a new conda environment with the following command. 
If you have never used conda before, please [read this guide first](https://biapol.github.io/blog/johannes_mueller/anaconda_getting_started/).

```
conda create -n napari-stress Python=3.9 napari jupyterlab -c conda-forge
conda activate napari-stress
```

You can then install napari-stress using pip:

```
pip install napari-stress
```
