Background
----------

This is a package for doing history-augmented MSM (haMSM) analysis on weighted ensemble trajectories.

Weighted ensemble data produced from simulations with recycling boundary conditions are naturally in a directional
ensemble.
This means that a history label can be assigned to every trajectory, and an haMSM can be constructed.

Features
--------

* Compute a history-augmented Markov state model from WESTPA weighted ensemble data
* Estimate steady-state distributions
* Estimate flux profiles
* Estimate committors
* WESTPA plugins to automate haMSM construction
* WESTPA plugin to automate bin+allocation optimization


Known Issues
------------

- Due to H5py version dependencies, this is currently not compatible with Python 3.10.

- Sometimes, on Python3.7 (and maybe below) the subprocess calls will fail. This may manifest as a silent failure,
  followed by hanging (which is very fun to debug!) To fix this, upgrade to Python 3.8+.

- If running with `$OMP_NUM_THREADS > 1`, Ray parallelism may occasionally silently hang during clustering / fluxmatrix calculations
