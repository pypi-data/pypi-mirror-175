    This class is used to manage the various fields that a resource (e.g.
    Chassis, Node, Port) contains.  An individual field consists of a
    'field_id' (key) and a 'label' (value).  The caller only provides the
    'field_ids' when instantiating the object.
    Ordering of the 'field_ids' will be preserved as specified by the caller.
    It also provides the ability to exclude some of these fields when they are
    being used for sorting.
