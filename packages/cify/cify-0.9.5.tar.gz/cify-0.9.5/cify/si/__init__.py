Swarm intelligence algorithms utilize swarms or :class:`Collection` s of :class:`Agent` s to find optima.
Currently, CIFY provides algorithms for particle swarm optimization (PSO), however, the provided objects and components
used for PSO can be adapted to work for other swarm intelligence algorithms.
