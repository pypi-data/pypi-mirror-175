# Linalg Basic

This library is slightly adapted from Joel Grus's Python linear algebra library as he wrote it in chapter 4 of his book *Data Science from Scratch*. I've assembled it purely to use its parts in my "Linalg Deluxe" library, which adds many more linear algebra operations.

Since Linalg Basic is largely Joel Grus's work, I've not bothered documenting it very well or testing it. More extensive documentation, testing, etc. can be found in my Linalg Deluxe library, which builds upon Linalg Basic and is actually my own original work. Go look at that, not this, for a proper demonstration of my skills.
