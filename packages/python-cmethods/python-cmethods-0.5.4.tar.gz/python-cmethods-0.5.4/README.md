Collection of different scale- and distribution-based bias adjustment techniques for climatic research (see `examples.ipynb` for help).

Bias adjustment procedures in Python are very slow, so they should not be used on large data sets.
A C++ implementation that works way faster can be found [here](https://github.com/btschwertfeger/Bias-Adjustment-Cpp).

## About

These programs and data structures are designed to help minimize discrepancies between modeled and observed climate data. Data from past periods are used to adjust variables from current and future time series so that their distributional properties approximate possible actual values.

In this way, for example, modeled data, which on average represent values that are too cold, can be adjusted by applying an adjustment procedure. The following figure shows the observed, the modeled and the adjusted values. It is directly visible that the delta adjusted time series ($T^{*DM}_{sim,p}$) are much more similar to the observed data ($T_{obs,p}$) than the raw modeled data ($T_{sim,p}$).

## Available methods:

- Linear Scaling (additive and multiplicative)
- Variance Scaling (additive)
- Delta (Change) Method (additive and multiplicative)
- Quantile Mapping (additive)
- Detrended Quantile Mapping (additive and multiplicative)
- Quantile Delta Mapping (additive and multuplicative)

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install python-cmethods
```

### Import and application

```python
import xarray as xr
from cmethods.CMethods import CMethods
cm = CMethods()

obsh = xr.open_dataset('input_data/obs.nc')
simh = xr.open_dataset('input_data/contr.nc')
simp = xr.open_dataset('input_data/scen.nc')

ls_result = cm.linear_scaling(
    obs = obsh['tas'][:,0,0],
    simh = simh['tas'][:,0,0],
    simp = simp['tas'][:,0,0],
    kind = '+' # *
)

qdm_result = cm.adjust_3d( # 3d = 2 spatial and 1 time dimension
    method = 'quantile_delta_mapping',
    obs = obsh['tas'],
    simh = simh['tas'],
    simp = simp['tas'],
    n_quaniles = 1000,
    kind = '+' # *
)
# * to calculate the relative rather than the absolute change,
# '*' can be used instead of '+' (this is prefered when adjusting
# ratio based variables like precipitation)
```

Notes:

- When using the `adjust_3d` method you have to specify the method by name.
- For the multiplicative linear scaling and delta method is a maximum scaling factor of 10 set. This can be changed by the `max_scaling_factor` parameter.

## Examples (see repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/btschwertfeger/Bias-Adjustment-Python))

`/examples/examples.ipynb`: Notebook containing different methods and plots

`/examples/do_bias_correction.py`: Example script for adjusting climate data

```bash
python3 do_bias_correction.py   \
    --obs input_data/obs.nc     \
    --contr input_data/contr.nc \
    --scen input_data/scen.nc   \
    --method linear_scaling     \
    --variable tas              \
    --unit '°C'                 \
    --group time.month          \
    --kind +
```

- Linear and variance, as well as delta change method require `--group time.month` as argument.
- Adjustment methods that apply changes in distributional biasses (QM, QDM, DQM; EQM, ...) need the `--nquantiles` argument set to some integer.
- Data sets should have the same spatial resolutions.

## Notes:

- Computation in Python takes some time, so this is only for demonstration. When adjusting large datasets, its best to the C++ implementation mentioned above.
- Formulas and references can be found in the implementations of the corresponding functions.
