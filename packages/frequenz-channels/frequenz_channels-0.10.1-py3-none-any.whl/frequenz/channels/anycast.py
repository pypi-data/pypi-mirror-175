    """A channel for sending data across async tasks.

    Anycast channels support multiple senders and multiple receivers.  A message sent
    through a sender will be received by exactly one receiver.

    In cases where each message need to be received by every receiver, a
    [Broadcast][frequenz.channels.Broadcast] channel may be used.

    Uses an [deque][collections.deque] internally, so Anycast channels are not
    thread-safe.

    When there are multiple channel receivers, they can be awaited
    simultaneously using [Select][frequenz.channels.Select],
    [Merge][frequenz.channels.Merge] or
    [MergeNamed][frequenz.channels.MergeNamed].

    Example:
        ``` python
        async def send(sender: channel.Sender) -> None:
            while True:
                next = random.randint(3, 17)
                print(f"sending: {next}")
                await sender.send(next)


        async def recv(id: int, receiver: channel.Receiver) -> None:
            while True:
                next = await receiver.receive()
                print(f"receiver_{id} received {next}")
                await asyncio.sleep(0.1) # sleep (or work) with the data


        acast = channel.Anycast()

        sender = acast.get_sender()
        receiver_1 = acast.get_receiver()

        asyncio.create_task(send(sender))

        await recv(1, receiver_1)
        ```
