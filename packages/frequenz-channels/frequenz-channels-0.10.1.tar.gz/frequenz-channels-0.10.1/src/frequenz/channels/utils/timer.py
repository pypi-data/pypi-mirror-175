        When you want something to happen with a fixed period:

        ```python
        timer = channel.Timer(30.0)
        select = Select(bat_1 = receiver1, timer = timer)

                # something to do once every 30 seconds
                pass
        ```

        When you want something to happen when nothing else has happened in a
        certain interval:

        ```python
        timer = channel.Timer(30.0)

                # something to do if there's no battery data for 30 seconds
