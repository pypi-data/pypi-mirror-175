Solver interface for `OSQP <https://osqp.org/>`__.

The OSQP solver implements an Operator-Splitting method for large-scale convex
quadratic programming. It is designed for both dense and sparse problems, and
convexity is the only assumption it makes on problem data (for instance, it
does not make any rank assumption contrary to :ref:`CVXOPT <CVXOPT rank
assumptions>` or :ref:`qpSWIFT <qpSWIFT rank assumptions>`).

    Solve a Quadratic Program defined as:

            \\frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\\\

            & A x = b
        \\end{array}\\end{split}

    using `OSQP <https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the problem is clearly non-convex. See `this recommendation
        <https://osqp.org/docs/interfaces/status_values.html#status-values>`_.
        Note that OSQP may find the problem unfeasible if the problem is
        slightly non-convex (in this context, the meaning of "clearly" and
        "slightly" depends on how close the negative eigenvalues of :math:`P`
        are to zero).

    Note
    ----
    OSQP requires a symmetric `P` and won't check for errors otherwise. Check
    out this point if you `get nan values
    <https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp/issues/10>`_ in your solutions.

    Notes
    -----
    Keyword arguments are forwarded to OSQP. For instance, we can call
    ``osqp_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, u, eps_abs=1e-8, eps_rel=0.0)``. OSQP settings
    include the following:

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 30 70
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Name
         - Description
       * - ``max_iter``
         - Maximum number of iterations.
       * - ``time_limit``
         - Run time limit in seconds, 0 to disable.
       * - ``eps_abs``
         - Absolute feasibility tolerance. See `Convergence
           <https://osqp.org/docs/solver/index.html#convergence>`__.
       * - ``eps_rel``
         - Relative feasibility tolerance. See `Convergence
           <https://osqp.org/docs/solver/index.html#convergence>`__.
       * - ``eps_prim_inf``
         - Primal infeasibility tolerance.
       * - ``eps_dual_inf``
         - Dual infeasibility tolerance.
       * - ``polish``
         - Perform polishing. See `Polishing
           <https://osqp.org/docs/solver/#polishing>`_.

    Check out the `OSQP settings
    <https://osqp.org/docs/interfaces/solver_settings.html>`_ documentation for
    all available settings..

    Lower values for absolute or relative tolerances yield more precise
    solutions at the cost of computation time. See *e.g.* [tolprimer]_ for an
    overview of solver tolerances.
