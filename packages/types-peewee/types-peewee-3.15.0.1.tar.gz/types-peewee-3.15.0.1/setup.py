## Typing stubs for peewee

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `peewee` package.

that uses `peewee`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/peewee. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
